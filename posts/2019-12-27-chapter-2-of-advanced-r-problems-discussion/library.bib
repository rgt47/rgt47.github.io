abstract = {BACKGROUND: The combination of a small pool of patients at any given time with the availability of many potential neuroprotective agents to be tested in ALS requires efficient phase II trial designs. OBJECTIVE: To describe the design of the Clinical Trial of High Dose Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in ALS (QALS study)--a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial. METHODS: The study design features two stages. The first stage (dose selection) identifies which of two doses of CoQ10 (1800 mg or 2700 mg) is preferred using a selection procedure rather than a formal hypothesis test. The second stage (early efficacy test) compares the preferred dose of CoQ10 against placebo using a non-superiority or futility design. Data from patients assigned to the preferred dose of CoQ10 in the first stage are also used in the second stage. The primary outcome measure is the decline in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRSr) score from baseline to 9 months. RESULTS: The total sample size required is 185 patients, as compared to a much larger sample size estimated to be necessary using a conventional superiority design (total: 852 patients). The authors report a bias correction made necessary by the inclusion of patient data from the first stage in the second stage. CONCLUSIONS: Several features of the Clinical Trial of High Dose Coenzyme Q10 in ALS study design promote efficiency. These features may be beneficial in phase II trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other fields.},

abstract = {High-dimensional pattern classification was applied to baseline and multiple follow-up MRI scans of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in order to investigate the potential of predicting short-term conversion to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) on an individual basis. MCI participants that converted to AD (average follow-up 15??months) displayed significantly lower volumes in a number of grey matter (GM) regions, as well as in the white matter (WM). They also displayed more pronounced periventricular small-vessel pathology, as well as an increased rate of increase of such pathology. Individual person analysis was performed using a pattern classifier previously constructed from AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) individuals to yield an abnormality score that is positive for AD-like brains and negative otherwise. The abnormality scores measured from MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) followed a bimodal distribution, reflecting the heterogeneity of this group, whereas they were positive in almost all MCI converters (MCI-C), indicating extensive patterns of AD-like brain atrophy in almost all MCI-C. Both MCI subgroups had similar MMSE scores at baseline. A more specialized classifier constructed to differentiate converters from non-converters based on their baseline scans provided good classification accuracy reaching 81.5{\%}, evaluated via cross-validation. These pattern classification schemes, which distill spatial patterns of atrophy to a single abnormality score, offer promise as biomarkers of AD and as predictors of subsequent clinical progression, on an individual patient basis. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Missing data are a recurring problem that can cause bias or lead to inefficient analyses. Development of statistical methods to address missingness have been actively pursued in recent years, including imputation, likelihood and weighting approaches. Each approach is more complicated when there are many patterns of missing values, or when both categorical and continuous random variables are involved. Implementations of routines to incorporate observations with incomplete variables in regression models are now widely available. We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be utilized in practice.},

abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of, if not the most, feared diseases associated with aging. The prevalence of AD increases exponentially with age after 60 years. Increasing life expectancy coupled with the absence of any approved disease-modifying therapies at present position AD as a dominant public health problem. Major advances have occurred in the development of disease biomarkers for AD in the past 2 decades. At present, the most well-developed AD biomarkers are the cerebrospinal fluid analytes amyloid-$\beta$ 42 and tau and the brain imaging measures amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and magnetic resonance imaging. CSF and imaging biomarkers are incorporated into revised diagnostic guidelines for AD, which have recently been updated for the first time since their original formulation in 1984. Results of recent studies suggest the possibility of an ordered evolution of AD biomarker abnormalities that can be used to stage the typical 20-30-year course of the disease. When compared with biomarkers in other areas of medicine, however, the absence of standardized quantitative metrics for AD imaging biomarkers constitutes a major deficiency. Failure to move toward a standardized system of quantitative metrics has substantially limited potential diagnostic usefulness of imaging in AD. This presents an important opportunity that, if widely embraced, could greatly expand the application of imaging to improve clinical diagnosis and the quality and efficiency of clinical trials.},

@article{Weber2007a,
abstract = {Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) differ in their actions on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ACE inhibitors prevent the formation of angiotensin II, although angiotensin II may still be generated by alternative pathways. However, ACE inhibitors interrupt bradykinin breakdown, which in turn potentially enhances nitric oxide and prostacyclin mechanisms. In contrast, ARBs selectively prevent the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor while leaving the potentially beneficial effects of the AT(2) receptor unaffected. The supposition is that dual blockade of the RAAS effectively overcomes the harmful effects of angiotensin II mediated by the AT(1) receptor while offering the additional effects of the ACE inhibitor. This concept was first evaluated clinically more than a decade ago in small-scale studies that were not sufficiently powered to conclusively demonstrate benefits from dual blockade. Subsequently, larger-scale trials have been conducted to determine the effects of a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in combating the effects of angiotensin II at different stages of cardiovascular and renal disease. This review explores these data in areas, such as hypertension, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease, and draws on this preliminary evidence to support the rationale for the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) program, which aims to fully explore the clinical end points and effects of dual RAAS blockade in patients at high risk for cardiovascular outcomes.},

Hence the sample size calculation at the planning stage of a clinical trial may also be questionable. Adjustment of the sample size during the mid-course of a clinical trial has become a popular strategy lately. In this paper we propose a procedure for calculating additional sample size needed based on conditional power, and adjusting the final-stage critical value to protect the overall type-I error rate. Compared to other previous procedures, the proposed procedure uses the definition of the conditional type-I error directly without appealing to an extra special function for it. It has better flexibility in setting up interim decision rules and the final-stage test is a likelihood ratio test.},

@article{Kivipelto2005a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vascular risk factors play a role in the development of dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD). However, little is known about the effect of body mass index and clustering of vascular risk factors on the development of dementia.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between midlife body mass index and clustering of vascular risk factors and subsequent dementia and AD.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants of the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) study were derived from random, population-based samples previously studied in a survey carried out in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. After an average follow-up of 21 years, 1449 individuals (73{\%}) aged 65 to 79 years participated in the reexamination in 1998.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dementia and AD.

RESULTS: Obesity at midlife (body mass index{\textgreater}30 kg/m2) was associated with the risk of dementia and AD even after adjusting for sociodemographic variables (odds ratio [OR], 2.4 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.2-5.1]). The association was somewhat modified by further adjusting for midlife blood pressure, total cholesterol level, and smoking (OR, 2.1 [95{\%} CI, 1.0-4.6]) and also for apolipoprotein E genotype and history of vascular disorders (OR, 1.9 [95{\%} CI, 0.8-4.6]). Midlife obesity, high total cholesterol level, and high systolic blood pressure were all significant risk factors for dementia with ORs of around 2 for each factor, and they increased the risk additively (OR, 6.2 for the combination).

CONCLUSIONS: Obesity at midlife is associated with an increased risk of dementia and AD later in life. Clustering of vascular risk factors increases the risk in an additive manner. The role of weight reduction for the prevention of dementia needs to be further investigated.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION CAD106 is designed to stimulate amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-specific antibody responses while avoiding T-cell autoimmune responses. The CAD106 first-in-human study demonstrated a favorable safety profile and promising antibody response. We investigated long-term safety, tolerability and antibody response after repeated CAD106 injections. METHODS Two phase IIa, 52-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled core studies (2201; 2202) and two 66-week open-label extension studies (2201E; 2202E) were conducted in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) aged 40 to 85 years. Patients were randomized to receive 150$\mu$g CAD106 or placebo given as three subcutaneous (2201) or subcutaneous/intramuscular (2202) injections, followed by four injections (150 $\mu$g CAD106; subcutaneous, 2201E1; intramuscular, 2202E1). Our primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated injections, including monitoring cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scans, adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs). Further objectives were to assess A$\beta$-specific antibody response in serum and A$\beta$-specific T-cell response (core only). Comparable A$\beta$-immunoglobulin G (IgG) exposure across studies supported pooled immune response assessments. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients were randomized (CAD106, n = 47; placebo, n = 11). Baseline demographics and characteristics were balanced. Forty-five patients entered extension studies. AEs occurred in 74.5{\%} of CAD106-treated patients versus 63.6{\%} of placebo-treated patients (core), and 82.2{\%} experienced AEs during extension studies. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity, were not study medication-related and did not require discontinuation. SAEs occurred in 19.1{\%} of CAD106-treated patients and 36.4{\%} of placebo-treated patients (core). One patient (CAD106-treated; 2201) reported a possibly study drug-related SAE of intracerebral hemorrhage. Four patients met criteria for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) corresponding to microhemorrhages: one was CAD106-treated (2201), one placebo-treated (2202) and two open-label CAD106-treated. No ARIA corresponded to vasogenic edema. Two patients discontinued extension studies because of SAEs (rectal neoplasm and rapid AD progression, respectively). Thirty CAD106-treated patients (63.8{\%}) were serological responders. Sustained A$\beta$-IgG titers and prolonged time to decline were observed in extensions versus core studies. Neither A$\beta$1-6 nor A$\beta$1-42 induced specific T-cell responses; however, positive control responses were consistently detected with the CAD106 carrier. CONCLUSIONS No unexpected safety findings or A$\beta$-specific T-cell responses support the CAD106 favorable tolerability profile. Long-term treatment-induced A$\beta$-specific antibody titers and prolonged time to decline indicate antibody exposure may increase with additional injections. CAD106 may be a valuable therapeutic option in AD.

abstract = {Introduction The objective of this study was to estimate longitudinal changes in disease progression (measured by Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive 11-item [ADAS-cog/11] scale) after bapineuzumab treatment and to identify covariates (demographics or baseline characteristics) contributing to the variability in disease progression rate and baseline disease status. Methods A population-based disease progression model was developed using pooled placebo and bapineuzumab data from two phase-3 studies in APOE $\epsilon$4 noncarrier and carrier Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Results A beta regression model with the Richard's function as the structural component best described ADAS-cog/11 disease progression for mild-to-moderate AD population. This analysis confirmed no effect of bapineuzumab exposure on ADAS-cog/11 progression rate, consistent with the lack of clinical efficacy observed in the statistical analysis of ADAS-cog/11 data in both studies. Assessment of covariates affecting baseline severity revealed that men had a 6{\%} lower baseline ADAS-cog/11 score than women; patients who took two AD concomitant medications had a 19{\%} higher (worse) baseline score; APOE $\epsilon$4 noncarriers had a 5{\%} lower baseline score; and patients who had AD for a longer duration had a higher baseline score. Furthermore, shorter AD duration, younger age, APOE $\epsilon$4 carrier status, and use of two AD concomitant medications were associated with faster disease progression rates. Patients who had an ADAS-cog/11 score progression rate that was not statistically significantly different from 0 typically took no AD concomitant medications. Discussion The beta regression model is a sensible modeling approach to characterize cognitive decline in AD patients. The influence of bapineuzumab exposure on disease progression measured by ADAS-cog/11 was not significant. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00575055 and NCT00574132.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) have been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease treated with bapineuzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against amyloid $\beta$. ARIA include MRI signal abnormalities suggestive of vasogenic oedema and sulcal effusions (ARIA-E) and microhaemorrhages and haemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H). Our aim was to investigate the incidence of ARIA during treatment with bapineuzumab, and evaluate associated risk factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed 2572 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI scans from 262 participants in two phase 2 studies of bapineuzumab and an open-label extension study. Readers were masked to the patient's treatment, APOE ɛ4 genotype, medical history, and demographics. Patients were included in risk analyses if they had no evidence of ARIA-E in their pre-treatment MRI, had received bapineuzumab, and had at least one MRI scan after treatment. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to examine the distribution of incident ARIA-E from the start of bapineuzumab treatment and proportional hazards regression models to assess risk factors associated with ARIA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: 210 patients were included in the risk analyses. 36 patients (17{\%}) developed ARIA-E during treatment with bapineuzumab; 15 of these ARIA-E cases (42{\%}) had not been detected previously. 28 of these patients (78{\%}) did not report associated symptoms. Adverse events, reported in eight symptomatic patients, included headache, confusion, and neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms. Incident ARIA-H occurred in 17 of the patients with ARIA-E (47{\%}), compared with seven of 177 (4{\%}) patients without ARIA-E. 13 of the 15 patients in whom ARIA were detected in our study received additional treatment infusions while ARIA-E were present, without any associated symptoms. Occurrence of ARIA-E increased with bapineuzumab dose (hazard ratio [HR] 2{\textperiodcentered}24 per 1 mg/kg increase in dose, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}40-3{\textperiodcentered}62; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0008) and presence of APOE ɛ4 alleles (HR 2{\textperiodcentered}55 per allele, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}57-4{\textperiodcentered}12; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: ARIA consist of a spectrum of imaging findings with variable clinical correlates, and some patients with ARIA-E remain asymptomatic even if treatment is continued. The increased risk of ARIA among APOE ɛ4 carriers, its association with high bapineuzumab dose, and its timecourse in relation to dosing suggest an association between ARIA and alterations in vascular amyloid burden.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: Elan Corporation, Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, and Pfizer.},

We describe a brief computerized neurocognitive "scan" that assesses similar domains with adequate reliability. The scan and a traditional battery were administered to a sample of 92 healthy individuals (44 men, 48 women) in a counterbalanced order. Both approaches showed a significant "sex-typical" gradient, with women outperforming men in verbal memory relative to spatial tasks. Both methods also yielded similar profiles of sex differences, with the additional computerized measure of face memory showing better performance in women. Age effects were evident for both methods, but the computerized scan isolated the effects to speed rather than accuracy. Therefore, the computerized scan has favorable reliability and construct validity and can be applied efficiently to study healthy variability related to age and gender.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis, and neuronal loss. Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, preferentially binds soluble forms of amyloid and in preclinical studies promoted its clearance from the brain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In two phase 3, double-blind trials (EXPEDITION 1 and EXPEDITION 2), we randomly assigned 1012 and 1040 patients, respectively, with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease to receive placebo or solanezumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 400 mg) every 4 weeks for 18 months. The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline to week 80 in scores on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11; range, 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL; range, 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating worse functioning). After analysis of data from EXPEDITION 1, the primary outcome for EXPEDITION 2 was revised to the change in scores on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater impairment), in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Neither study showed significant improvement in the primary outcomes. The modeled difference between groups (solanezumab group minus placebo group) in the change from baseline was -0.8 points for the ADAS-cog11 score (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -2.1 to 0.5; P=0.24) and -0.4 points for the ADCS-ADL score (95{\%} CI, -2.3 to 1.4; P=0.64) in EXPEDITION 1 and -1.3 points (95{\%} CI, -2.5 to 0.3; P=0.06) and 1.6 points (95{\%} CI, -0.2 to 3.3; P=0.08), respectively, in EXPEDITION 2. Between-group differences in the changes in the ADAS-cog14 score were -1.7 points in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (95{\%} CI, -3.5 to 0.1; P=0.06) and -1.5 in patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease (95{\%} CI, -4.1 to 1.1; P=0.26). In the combined safety data set, the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or hemorrhage was 0.9{\%} with solanezumab and 0.4{\%} with placebo for edema (P=0.27) and 4.9{\%} and 5.6{\%}, respectively, for hemorrhage (P=0.49).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.

abstract = {Background: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) has become the de facto gold standard for assessing the efficacy of anti-dementia treatments. However, manual administration of the ADAS-Cog is subject to procedural inconsistencies, including scoring and transcription errors, which can introduce unwanted variance and compromise data quality within and across sites and trials. To address such concerns, a computerized version was developed that integrates, rather than replaces, the examiner, standardizes administration, and uses electronic data capture at the point of patient contact. The examiner can control administration and pacing, pause or repeat digitized instructions, score verbal report and overt behavioral performance, and freely interact with the subject. Purpose: To conduct psychometric comparisons of traditional, paper-based administration of the standard ADAS-Cog (sADAS) with examiner-assisted administration of the computerized ADAS-Cog (cADAS). Methods: Eighty-eight patients (39M; 49F) with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease were tested on three occasions with each version over a period of one year with one month between paired visits. Results: Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) comparisons between sADAS and cADAS were significant for total score (ICC=0.96) and all subscores (ICCs ranged 0.78-0.93), with no significant differences on paired t-tests. The mean ICCs across cADAS scores for test-retest reliability for short-term (mean ICC=0.96) and long-term (mean ICC=0.91) comparisons were significantly higher than across sADAS scores (mean ICCs were 0.87 and 0.84, respectively). Conclusions: These results indicate that examiner-assisted, computerized administration is equivalent to traditional, paper-based administration, and shows significantly greater test-retest reliability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

The null distribution can be estimated by means of bootstrap or permutation procedures. Although very easy to implement, such procedures can become computationally expensive as the sample size or the dimension of the data increase. This paper proposes to approximate the null distribution through a weighted bootstrap. The method is studied both theoretically and numerically. It provides a consistent estimator of the null distribution. The asymptotic properties are similar to those of the bootstrap and permutation estimators but, from a computational point of view, the weighted bootstrap estimator is more efficient. The proposed approach is also applied to the two-sample location problem and to the k-sample problem.},

Our example is the UK700 trial of psychiatric case management, where the total number of days spent in hospital over a 2-year follow-up was the primary outcome. Investigations of treatment effect modifiers were undertaken using an analysis of that primary outcome, a comparison of length of hospitalizations, and also a multi-state modeling approach. The days in hospital outcome was relatively straightforward to analyze, and allowed the complete randomized treatment groups to be compared. In contrast, the comparison of length of hospitalizations included only hospitalized patients, with censored observations not being well accommodated. The multi-state model provided separate treatment effect estimates for admission and discharge, this being more informative about how any reduction in days spent in hospital is achieved. Estimation of the treatment effects through the use of proportional hazards regression allowed appropriate incorporation of censored observations. However, with the multi-state model approach treatment effect estimates are not based upon comparisons of complete randomized treatment groups, as individuals are removed from the risk set for admission whilst at risk for discharge, and vice versa. We conclude that total duration is an appropriate primary outcome for clinical trials, but that multi-state models deserve greater use as an informative secondary analysis.},

The goal of the design is to skew the allocation probability to more efficacious treatment arms, while also balancing the distribution of the covariates across the arms. In particular, we first propose a new covariate-adaptive randomization (CA) method based on a prognostic score that naturally accommodates continuous and categorical prognostic factors and automatically assigns imbalance weights to covariates according to their importance in response prediction. We then incorporate this CA design into a group sequential response-adaptive randomization (RA) scheme. The resulting RC randomization design combines the advantages of both CA and RA randomizations and meets the design goal. We illustrate the proposed design through its application to a phase II leukemia clinical trial, and evaluate its operating characteristics through simulation studies.},

abstract = {Re-randomization test has been considered as a robust alternative to the traditional population model-based methods for analyzing randomized clinical trials. This is especially so when the clinical trials are randomized according to minimization, which is a popular covariate-adaptive randomization method for ensuring balance among prognostic factors. Among various re-randomization tests, fixed-entry-order re-randomization is advocated as an effective strategy when a temporal trend is suspected. Yet when the minimization is applied to trials with unequal allocation, fixed-entry-order re-randomization test is biased and thus compromised in power. We find that the bias is due to non-uniform re-allocation probabilities incurred by the re-randomization in this case. We therefore propose a weighted fixed-entry-order re-randomization test to overcome the bias. The performance of the new test was investigated in simulation studies that mimic the settings of a real clinical trial. The weighted re-randomization test was found to work well in the scenarios investigated including the presence of a strong temporal trend.},

The results reveal that (i) an increase in the frequency of visits does not increase statistical power, (ii) a skewed randomization for a placebo or comparator arm may decrease statistical power, and (iii) analysis of the percentage of responders should be avoided. CTS should become best practice in the optimization of study design. To date, no other statistical approach has enabled such comprehensive evaluation of the factors contributing to study failure in depression.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE As Alzheimer disease (AD) research moves to intervene in presymptomatic phases of the disease, we must develop outcome measures sensitive to the earliest disease-related changes. OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility of a cognitive composite outcome for clinically normal elderly participants with evidence of AD pathology using the ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS With the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES For the 2 studies that collected data on A$\beta$ levels (ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD "A$\beta$-positive" placebo group and compare them with an "A$\beta$-negative" group. For the study that did not include data on A$\beta$ levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we grouped participants by the presence of APOE-$\epsilon$4 and by clinical progression. RESULTS In ADNI, A$\beta$-positive participants showed more decline than did A$\beta$-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean [SE] difference, -1.239 [0.522] [95{\%} CI, -2.263 to -0.215]; P = .02). In AIBL, the mean (SE) difference is significant at both 18 months (-1.009 [0.406] [95{\%} CI, -1.805 to -0.213]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.404 [0.452] [95{\%} CI, -2.290 to -0.519]; P = .002). In the ADCS-PI study, APOE-$\epsilon$4 allele carriers performed significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC at 24 months (mean [SE] score, -0.742 [0.294] [95{\%} CI, -1.318 to -0.165]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.531 [0.469] [95{\%} CI, -2.450 to -0.612]; P = .001). In the ADCS-PI study, cognitively normal participants who progress from a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 are significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC than cognitively normal participants who are stable with a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 at months 12, 24, and 36 (mean [SE] ADCS-PACC score, -4.471 [0.702] [95{\%} CI, -5.848 to -3.094]; P {\textless} .001). Using pilot estimates of variance and assuming 500 participants per group with 30{\%} attrition and a 5{\%} $\alpha$ level, we project 80{\%} power to detect effects in the range of $\Delta$ = 0.467 to 0.733 on the ADCS-PACC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Analyses of at-risk cognitively normal populations suggest that we can reliably measure the first signs of cognitive decline with the ADCS-PACC. These analyses also suggest the feasibility of secondary prevention trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain is often managed using IV patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). In this analysis of pooled data, we compared the safety and efficacy of the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system (ITS) with morphine IV PCA.

METHODS: Data were obtained from three multicenter, randomized, active-controlled trials (N = 1941). The primary efficacy measure was success ("good"/"excellent" ratings) on the 24-h patient global assessment of the method of pain control. Pain intensity, relative dosing ratios, discontinuation rates, and adverse events were assessed. Efficacy was evaluated across age, surgery type, and body mass index (BMI).

RESULTS: Comparable percentages of patients reported success on the 24-h patient global assessment of the method of pain control (fentanyl ITS, 80.5{\%}; morphine IV PCA, 81.0{\%}; difference = -0.5{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, -4.0{\%} to 3.0{\%}). Mean last pain intensity scores in the first 24 h were comparable (fentanyl ITS, 3.1; morphine IV PCA, 3.0; difference = 0.07; 95{\%} confidence interval, -0.14 to 0.29). Relative dosing ratios of fentanyl to morphine overall and in subpopulations (age, BMI) were comparable over 6, 12, and 24 h. Fentanyl ITS was equally effective when compared with morphine IV PCA for patient subpopulations (age, surgery type, and BMI). Discontinuation rates and the incidence of adverse events were similar between groups.

CONCLUSIONS: These pooled data represent one of the largest head-to-head comparisons of fentanyl versus morphine in a postoperative acute pain setting. Results suggest that fentanyl ITS is effective across subpopulations defined by age and BMI, and support a consistent safety and efficacy profile of fentanyl delivered by fentanyl ITS for postoperative pain management.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) plaques in the brain. A$\beta$ is produced from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by $\beta$-site amyloid precursor protein–cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) followed by $\gamma$-secretase. Verubecestat is an oral BACE-1 inhibitor that reduces the A$\beta$ level in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 78-week trial to evaluate verubecestat at doses of 12 mg and 40 mg per day, as compared with placebo, in patients who had a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The coprimary outcomes were the change from baseline to week 78 in the score on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog; scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating worse dementia) and in the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory scale (ADCS-ADL; scores ra...},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE—Cerebral amyloid-$\beta$ aggregation is an early pathological event in Alzheimer disease (AD), starting decades before dementia onset. Estimates of the prevalence of amyloid pathology in persons without dementia are needed to understand the development of AD and to design prevention studies. OBJECTIVE—To use individual participant data meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of amyloid pathology as measured with biomarkers in participants with normal cognition, subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DATA SOURCES—Relevant biomarker studies identified by searching studies published before April 2015 using the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases and through personal communication with investigators. STUDY SELECTION—Studies were included if they provided individual participant data for participants without dementia and used an a priori defined cutoff for amyloid positivity. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS—Individual records were provided for 2914 participants with normal cognition, 697 with SCI, and 3972 with MCI aged 18 to 100 years from 55 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Prevalence of amyloid pathology on positron emission tomography or in cerebrospinal fluid according to AD risk factors (age, apolipoprotein E [APOE] genotype, sex, and education) estimated by generalized estimating equations. RESULTS—The prevalence of amyloid pathology increased from age 50 to 90 years from 10{\%} (95{\%} CI, 8{\%}-13{\%}) to 44{\%} (95{\%} CI, 37{\%}-51{\%}) among participants with normal cognition; from 12{\%} (95{\%} CI, 8{\%}-18{\%}) to 43{\%} (95{\%} CI, 32{\%}-55{\%}) among patients with SCI; and from 27{\%} (95{\%} CI, 23{\%}-32{\%}) to 71{\%} (95{\%} CI, 66{\%}-76{\%}) among patients with MCI. APOE-$\epsilon$4 carriers had 2 to 3 times higher prevalence estimates than noncarriers. The age at which 15{\%} of the participants with normal cognition were amyloid positive was approximately 40 years for APOE$\epsilon$4$\epsilon$4 carriers, 50 years for $\epsilon$2$\epsilon$4 carriers, 55 years for $\epsilon$3$\epsilon$4 carriers, 65 years for $\epsilon$3$\epsilon$3 carriers, and 95 years for $\epsilon$2$\epsilon$3 carriers. Amyloid positivity was more common in highly educated participants but not associated with sex or biomarker modality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among persons without dementia, the prevalence of cerebral amyloid pathology as determined by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid findings was associated with age, APOEgenotype, and presence of cognitive impairment. These findings suggest a 20- to 30-year interval between first development of amyloid positivity and onset of dementia. Alzheimer},

abstract = {Currently available evidence strongly supports the position that the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to abnormal processing of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, ultimately leading to formation of Abeta plaques in the brain. This process occurs while individuals are still cognitively normal. Biomarkers of brain beta-amyloidosis are reductions in CSF Abeta(42) and increased amyloid PET tracer retention. After a lag period, which varies from patient to patient, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the dominant pathological processes. Biomarkers of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration are increased CSF tau and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction, which is indicated by decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET. We propose a model that relates disease stage to AD biomarkers in which Abeta biomarkers become abnormal first, before neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive symptoms, and neurodegenerative biomarkers become abnormal later, and correlate with clinical symptom severity.},

Although there is broad consensus that Alzheimer's disease (AD) should be treated during its earliest stages, the concept of secondary prevention has evolved to be described more accurately as treatment of preclinical, presymptomatic, or early AD. There continues to be a strong emphasis on biomarkers and a need for new biomarkers; however, there has also been a realization, based on completed trials, that the most reliable indicator of clinical efficacy across the entire spectrum of disease from asymptomatic to AD dementia is likely a measure of cognition. The task force made many recommendations that should improve the likelihood of success in future trials, including larger phase 2 or combined phase 2/phase 3 studies, clear evidence of target engagement in the central nervous system, evidence of downstream effects on biomarkers before initiating phase 3 studies, consideration of adaptive and targeted trial designs, and use of sensitive measures of cognition as the most robust indicator of treatment benefit. ?? 2013 The Alzheimer's Association.

In this paper we argue that the hypothesis of treatment effect in a small pilot study should be set up to test whether any individual subject has an effect rather than whether the group mean or median has shifted as often done for large, confirmatory clinical trials. Based on this paradigm we propose multiple test procedures as one option when individuals have enough observations, and a mixture-distribution approach when individuals have one or more observations. The latter approach may be used in either a one- or two-group setting, and is our focus in this paper. We present the likelihood ratio tests for the mixture models. Examples are given to demonstrate the methods.},

abstract = {The authors examined associations between exposure to aluminum or silica from drinking water and risk of cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease among elderly subjects followed for 15 years (1988-2003). They actively searched for incident cases of dementia among persons aged 65 years or over living in 91 civil drinking-water areas in southern France. Two measures of exposure to aluminum were assessed: geographic exposure and individual exposure, taking into account daily consumption of tap water and bottled water. A total of 1,925 subjects who were free of dementia at baseline and had reliable water assessment data were analyzed. Using random-effects models, the authors found that cognitive decline with time was greater in subjects with a higher daily intake of aluminum from drinking water ({\textgreater}or=0.1 mg/day, P=0.005) or higher geographic exposure to aluminum. Using a Cox model, a high daily intake of aluminum was significantly associated with increased risk of dementia. Conversely, an increase of 10 mg/day in silica intake was associated with a reduced risk of dementia (adjusted relative risk =0.89, P=0.036). However, geographic exposure to aluminum or silica from tap water was not associated with dementia. High consumption of aluminum from drinking water may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is one of the most disabling chronic conditions worldwide, resulting in significant human, social and economic costs and placing huge demands on health care systems. The Inala Chronic Disease Management Service aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of care for patients with type 2 diabetes who have been referred by their general practitioner to a specialist diabetes outpatient clinic. Care is provided by a multidisciplinary, integrated team consisting of an endocrinologist, diabetes nurse educators, General Practitioner Clinical Fellows (general practitioners who have undertaken focussed post-graduate training in complex diabetes care), and allied health personnel (a dietitian, podiatrist and psychologist).

METHODS/DESIGN: Using a geographical control, this evaluation study tests the impact of this model of diabetes care provided by the service on patient outcomes compared to usual care provided at the specialist diabetes outpatient clinic. Data collection at baseline, 6 and 12-months will compare the primary outcome (glycaemic control) and secondary outcomes (serum lipid profile, blood pressure, physical activity, smoking status, quality of life, diabetes self-efficacy and cost-effectiveness).

DISCUSSION: This model of diabetes care combines the patient focus and holistic care valued by the primary care sector with the specialised knowledge and skills of hospital diabetes care. Our study will provide empirical evidence about the clinical effectiveness of this model of care.

This article reviews the activities and accomplishments of the core in support of ADNI aims. These include the enrollment and follow-up of more than 800 subjects in the three original cohorts: healthy controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (now referred to as late MCI, or LMCI), and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the first phase of ADNI (ADNI 1), with baseline longitudinal, clinical, and cognitive assessments. These data, when combined with genetic, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid measures, have provided important insights into the neurobiology of the AD spectrum. Furthermore, these data have facilitated the development of novel clinical trial designs. ADNI has recently been extended with funding from an NIH Grand Opportunities (GO) award, and the new ADNI GO phase has been launched; this includes the enrollment of a new cohort, called early MCI, with milder episodic memory impairment than the LMCI group. An application for a further 5 years of ADNI funding (ADNI 2) was recently submitted. This funding would support ongoing follow-up of the original ADNI 1 and ADNI GO cohorts, as well as additional recruitment into all categories. The resulting data would provide valuable data on the earliest stages of AD, and support the development of interventions in these critically important populations. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Alzheimer's Association.

The algorithms are presented for the two-sample problem and it is shown how to extend them to the multisample problem—for example, to find the distribution of the Kruskal-Wallis and other extensions of the Wilcoxon—and to the single-sample situation. Stratification, ties, and censored observations are also easily handled by the algorithms.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: If in a clinical trial prognostic factors are known in advance to be associated with the outcome of a patient it is often recommended that the randomization for a clinical trial should be stratified on these factors, particularly in a multicenter trial. Unfortunately, stratified or covariate-adaptive randomization does not always promote greater balance between the numbers of treatment assignments to A and B within each stratum and thus overall. Because such designs have numerous parameters that must be specified, simulation is a good tool to investigate the impact of these parameters on balance.

METHODS: We investigate and discuss in more detail the difference in balancing performance of three stratified randomization procedures. The permuted-block randomization within strata, the "minimization" method and "self-adjusting" design are assessed overall, within levels of prognostic factors, and within strata.

RESULTS: We show the superior performance of "self-adjusting" design and the extent of balancing losses occurring with permuted-block randomization within levels of factors and with "minimization" within strata. A summary of principal conclusions regarding the balancing properties of stratified randomization procedures is presented and general recommendations are offered.

CONCLUSIONS: The relative merits of each procedure should be weighted carefully in relation to the characteristics of the trial. Considering the likelihood of imbalances, the sample size and values of parameters of stratified randomization procedures (number of prognostic factors, number of factor levels, block size) are important when choosing a randomization procedure.},

@article{Matts1988,
abstract = {This article describes some of the important statistical properties of the commonly used permuted-block design, also known simply as blocked-randomization. Under a permutation model for statistical tests, proper analyses should employ tests that incorporate the blocking used in the randomization. These include the block-stratified Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for binary data, the blocked analysis of variance F test, and the blocked nonparametric linear rank test. It is common, however, to ignore the blocking in the analysis. For these tests, it is shown that the size of a test obtained from an analysis incorporating the blocking (say T), versus an analysis ignoring the blocking (say TI), is related to the intrablock correlation coefficient (R) as TI = T(1-R). For blocks of common length 2m, the range of R is from -1/(2m-1) to 1. Thus, if there is a positive intrablock correlation, which is more likely than not for m greater than 1, an analysis ignoring blocking will be unduly conservative. Permutation tests are also presented for the case of stratified analyses within one or more subgroups of patients defined post hoc on the basis of a covariate. This provides a basis for the analysis when responses from some patients are assumed to be missing-at-random. An alternative strategy that requires no assumptions is to perform the analysis using only the subset of complete blocks in which no observations are missing. The Blackwell-Hodges model is used to assess the potential for selection bias induced by investigator attempts to guess which treatment is more likely to be assigned to each incoming patient. In an unmasked trial, the permuted-block design provides substantial potential for selection bias in the comparison of treatments due to the predictability of the assignments that is induced by the requirement of balance within blocks. Further, this bias is not eliminated by the use of random block sizes. We also modify the Blackwell-Hodges model to allow for selection bias only when the investigator is able to discern the next assignment with certainty. This type of bias is reduced by the use of random block sizes and is eliminated only if the possible block sizes are unknown to the investigators. Finally, the Efron model for accidental bias is used to assess the potential for bias in the estimation of treatment effects due to covariate imbalances. For the permuted-block design, the variance of this bias approaches that of complete randomization as the half-block length m----infinity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cluster analysis has become a standard computational method for gene function discovery as well as for more general explanatory data analysis. A number of different approaches have been proposed for that purpose, out of which different mixture models provide a principled probabilistic framework. Cluster analysis is increasingly often supplemented with multiple data sources nowadays, and these heterogeneous information sources should be made as efficient use of as possible.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This paper presents a novel Beta-Gaussian mixture model (BGMM) for clustering genes based on Gaussian distributed and beta distributed data. The proposed BGMM can be viewed as a natural extension of the beta mixture model (BMM) and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The proposed BGMM method differs from other mixture model based methods in its integration of two different data types into a single and unified probabilistic modeling framework, which provides a more efficient use of multiple data sources than methods that analyze different data sources separately. Moreover, BGMM provides an exceedingly flexible modeling framework since many data sources can be modeled as Gaussian or beta distributed random variables, and it can also be extended to integrate data that have other parametric distributions as well, which adds even more flexibility to this model-based clustering framework. We developed three types of estimation algorithms for BGMM, the standard expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, an approximated EM and a hybrid EM, and propose to tackle the model selection problem by well-known model selection criteria, for which we test the Akaike information criterion (AIC), a modified AIC (AIC3), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and the integrated classification likelihood-BIC (ICL-BIC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Performance tests with simulated data show that combining two different data sources into a single mixture joint model greatly improves the clustering accuracy compared with either of its two extreme cases, GMM or BMM. Applications with real mouse gene expression data (modeled as Gaussian distribution) and protein-DNA binding probabilities (modeled as beta distribution) also demonstrate that BGMM can yield more biologically reasonable results compared with either of its two extreme cases. One of our applications has found three groups of genes that are likely to be involved in Myd88-dependent Toll-like receptor 3/4 (TLR-3/4) signaling cascades, which might be useful to better understand the TLR-3/4 signal transduction.},

Based on imaging markers, CN individuals were categorized into the following preclinical Alzheimer disease stages: stage 0 (A$\beta$-/ND-), stage 1 (A$\beta$(+)/ND-), stage 2 (A$\beta$(+)/ND(+)), and suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathology (A$\beta$-/ND(+)).

In assessing longitudinal cognitive performance, practice effects were evident in CN individuals negative for both A$\beta$ and ND, whereas diminished practice effects were observed in CN individuals positive for either A$\beta$ or ND. Decline over time was observed only in CN individuals positive for both A$\beta$ and ND, and decline in this group was significantly greater than that in all other groups (P {\textless} .001 for all). A significant interaction term between A$\beta$ and ND confirmed that this decline was greater than the additive contributions of A$\beta$ and ND (P = .04).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The co-occurrence of A$\beta$ and ND accelerates cognitive decline in CN individuals. Therefore, both factors are important to consider in upcoming secondary prevention trials targeting CN individuals at high risk for progression to the symptomatic stages of Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {A genome-wide survival analysis of 14,406 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and 25,849 controls identified eight previously reported AD risk loci and 14 novel loci associated with age at onset. Linkage disequilibrium score regression of 220 cell types implicated the regulation of myeloid gene expression in AD risk. The minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus, showed association with delayed AD onset and lower expression of SPI1 in monocytes and macrophages. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability was enriched within the PU.1 cistrome, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in AD. Finally, experimentally altered PU.1 levels affected the expression of mouse orthologs of many AD risk genes and the phagocytic activity of mouse microglial cells. Our results suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces AD risk by regulating myeloid gene expression and cell function.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Develop a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker signature for mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects.

METHODS: Amyloid-beta 1 to 42 peptide (A beta(1-42)), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 were measured in (1) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained during baseline evaluation of 100 mild AD, 196 mild cognitive impairment, and 114 elderly cognitively normal (NC) subjects in ADNI; and (2) independent 56 autopsy-confirmed AD cases and 52 age-matched elderly NCs using a multiplex immunoassay. Detection of an AD CSF profile for t-tau and A beta(1-42) in ADNI subjects was achieved using receiver operating characteristic cut points and logistic regression models derived from the autopsy-confirmed CSF data.

RESULTS: CSF A beta(1-42) was the most sensitive biomarker for AD in the autopsy cohort of CSF samples: receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.913 and sensitivity for AD detection of 96.4{\%}. In the ADNI cohort, a logistic regression model for A beta(1-42), t-tau, and APO epsilon 4 allele count provided the best assessment delineation of mild AD. An AD-like baseline CSF profile for t-tau/A beta(1-42) was detected in 33 of 37 ADNI mild cognitive impairment subjects who converted to probable AD during the first year of the study.

INTERPRETATION: The CSF biomarker signature of AD defined by A beta(1-42) and t-tau in the autopsy-confirmed AD cohort and confirmed in the cohort followed in ADNI for 12 months detects mild AD in a large, multisite, prospective clinical investigation, and this signature appears to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD.},

abstract = {Background There is growing interest in the evaluation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments. As a result, there is a need to identify a cognitive composite that is sensitive to track preclinical AD decline to be used as a primary endpoint in treatment trials. Methods Longitudinal data from initially cognitively normal, 70- to 85-year-old participants in three cohort studies of aging and dementia from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center were examined to empirically define a composite cognitive endpoint that is sensitive to detect and track cognitive decline before the onset of cognitive impairment. The mean-to-standard deviation ratios (MSDRs) of change over time were calculated in a search for the optimal combination of cognitive tests/subtests drawn from the neuropsychological battery in cognitively normal participants who subsequently progressed to clinical stages of AD during 2- and 5-year periods, using data from those who remained unimpaired during the same period to correct for aging and practice effects. Combinations that performed well were then evaluated for representation of relevant cognitive domains, robustness across individual years before diagnosis, and occurrence of selected items within top performing combinations. Results The optimal composite cognitive test score comprised seven cognitive tests/subtests with an MSDR = 0.964. By comparison, the most sensitive individual test score was Logical Memory Delayed Recall with an MSDR = 0.64. Conclusions We have identified a composite cognitive test score representing multiple cognitive domains that has improved power compared with the most sensitive single test item to track preclinical AD decline and evaluate preclinical AD treatments. We are confirming the power of the composite in independent cohorts and with other analytical approaches, which may result in refinements, have designated it as the primary endpoint in the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative's preclinical treatment trials for individuals at high imminent risk for developing symptoms due to late-onset AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cerebral atrophy that may be measured using MRI. Reported are MRI findings of a Phase IIa immunotherapy trial in AD prematurely terminated owing to meningoencephalitis in a subset of patients.

OBJECTIVE: To assess cerebral volume changes in patients immunized with AN1792 (beta-amyloid [Abeta] 1 to 42) who were antibody responders (anti-AN1792 IgG titer of {\textgreater} or =1:2,200) compared with placebo patients.

METHODS: This randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of AN1792 225 mug plus QS-21 50 mug included 372 patients with probable AD. Patients received one to three injections of AN1792/QS-21 or saline and were assessed for 12 months. Volumetric MRI was performed pre dose and at month 12 or early termination. Brain, ventricular, and hippocampal volume changes were measured from registered scan pairs.

RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-eight patients had paired scans (mean interval 10.9 months). Antibody responders (n = 45) had greater brain volume decrease (3.12 +/- 1.98 vs 2.04 +/- 1.74{\%}; p = 0.007), greater ventricular enlargement as a percentage of baseline brain volume (1.10 +/- 0.75 vs 0.48 +/- 0.40{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001), and a nonsignificant greater hippocampal volume decrease (3.78 +/- 2.63 vs 2.86 +/- 3.19{\%}; p = 0.124) than placebo patients (n = 57). Increased losses in brain volume were not reflected in worsening cognitive performance; a composite z score across a Neuropsychological Test Battery showed differences favoring antibody responders over placebo (0.03 +/- 0.39 vs -0.24 +/- 0.45; p = 0.008).

CONCLUSIONS: A dissociation between brain volume loss and cognitive function was observed in AN1792/QS-21 antibody responders. The reasons for this remain unclear but include the possibility that volume changes were due to amyloid removal and associated cerebral fluid shifts.},

There are no studies that have compared these two drugs directly and hence this paper aims to review studies that are available for each drug. There are only six controlled studies that have examined the effects of somatostatin-14 and octreotide on fistula output reduction, three for each drug. All studies compared conservative therapy and the drug in combination with conservative therapy. Of the somatostatin-14 studies, two showed a significant effect on output (p{\textless}0.05) and the other demonstrated an output reduction on day 1 that was twice that in the control group (NS). Of the octreotide studies, one showed a significant effect (p{\textless}0.01) and the other two showed no effect of the drug on output. No study with either drug has demonstrated an increase in the number of patients that have achieved closure. However, a positive effect on the time to achieve closure has been found. Of the five controlled studies with somatostatin-14, all showed a significant reduction in time to closure. Of the two controlled studies with octreotide, one showed a significant reduction (p=0.002) and the other showed no difference. Due to the limited number of trials, a definitive evaluation of the efficacies of somatostatin-14 and octreotide in the treatment of gastrointestinal fistulae is not possible. However, currently available information seems to suggest a considerable benefit of somatostatin-14 when administered in association with standard conservative treatment, but this needs to be confirmed in a large prospective controlled study.},

abstract = {Many clinical trials organizations use regular interim analyses to monitor the accruing results in large clinical trials. In disease areas such as cancer, where survival is usually a major outcome variable, ethical considerations may lead to a stipulated requirement for data monitoring of mortality. This monitoring has frequently taken the form of limiting interim analyses to be few in number, and specifying an extreme p-value of, for example, p {\textless} 0.001 or p {\textless} 0.01 as grounds for early termination of the trial. Group-sequential methods are also used. However, none of these approaches formally assesses the impact that the results of a clinical trial may have upon clinical practice. Thus a trial might be terminated early because of apparent treatment benefits, but might fail to influence sceptical clinicians to modify their future treatment policy. We discuss the application of Bayesian methods, including the use of uninformative, sceptical and enthusiastic priors, and demonstrate that the necessary calculations are both straightforward to perform and easy to interpret statistically and clinically. Methods are illustrated with interim analyses of a clinical trial in oesophageal cancer.},

abstract = {Introduction We discuss optimization and validation of composite end points for presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Optimized composites offer hope of substantial gains in statistical power or reduction in sample size. But there is tradeoff between optimization and face validity such that optimization should only be considered if there is a convincing rationale. As with statistically derived regions of interest in neuroimaging, validation on independent data sets is essential. Methods Using four data sets, we consider the optimized weighting of four components of a cognitive composite which includes measures of (1) global cognition, (2) semantic memory, (3) episodic memory, and (4) executive function. Weights are optimized to either discriminate amyloid positivity or maximize power to detect a treatment effect in an amyloid-positive population. We apply repeated 5 × 3-fold cross-validation to quantify the out-of-sample performance of optimized composite end points. Results We found the optimized weights varied greatly across the folds of the cross-validation with either optimization method. Both optimization methods tend to down-weight the measures of global cognition and executive function. However, when these optimized composites were applied to the validation sets, they did not provide consistent improvements in power. In fact, overall, the optimized composites performed worse than those without optimization. Discussion We find that component weight optimization does not yield valid improvements in sensitivity of this composite to detect treatment effects.},

abstract = {We compared plasma levels of beta-amyloid 1-42 (pg/ml) found for 146 sporadic Alzheimer (AD) patients, 89 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 89 age-matched controls (CT). AD patients had significantly lower levels (38, 54, 52; p{\textless}0.01), unrelated to severity of the disease as assessed by MMSE score, age, sex or APOE4 status. Twenty cases investigated at two time points 18 months apart did not demonstrate further decreases. Thus, the reduction in beta-amyloid 1-42 may be a marker for AD status, specifically, a transition from normal status or MCI to AD, rather than a marker for neurodegenerative processes occurring in the disease.},

abstract = {Pretest-posttest designs serve as building blocks for other more complicated repeated-measures designs. In settings where subjects are independent and errors follow a bivariate normal distribution, data analysis may consist of a univariate repeated-measures analysis or an analysis of covariance. Another possible analysis approach is to use seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The purpose of this article is to help guide the statistician toward an appropriate analysis choice. Assumptions, estimates, and test statistics for each analysis are approached in a systematic manner. On the basis of these results, the crucial choice of analysis is whether differences in pretest group means are conceived to be real or the result of pure measurement error. Direct consultation of the statistician with a subject-matter person is important in making the right choice. If pretest group differences are real, then a univariate repeated-measures analysis is recommended. If pretest group differences are the result of pure measurement error, then a conditional analysis or SUR analysis should be used. The conditional analysis and the SUR analysis will produce similar results. Smaller variance estimates can be expected based on the SUR analysis, but this gain is partially mediated by a lack of an exact distribution for test statistics.},

However, despite a number of recent enhancements to the method, its acceptance in actual clinical practice has been hampered by several practical difficulties. In this paper, we consider several further refinements in the context of phase I oncology trials. In particular, we allow the trial to stop when the width of the posterior 95 per cent probability interval for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) becomes sufficiently narrow (that is, when the information accumulating from the trial data reaches a prespecified level). We employ a simulation study to evaluate five such stopping rules under three alternative states of prior knowledge regarding the MTD (accurate, too low and too high). Our results suggest our adaptive designs preserve the CRM's estimation ability while offering the possibility of earlier stopping of the trial.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (APOE) dependent lifetime risks (LTRs) for Alzheimer Disease (AD) are currently not accurately known and odds ratios alone are insufficient to assess these risks. We calculated AD LTR in 7351 cases and 10 132 controls from Caucasian ancestry using Rochester (USA) incidence data. At the age of 85 the LTR of AD without reference to APOE genotype was 11{\%} in males and 14{\%} in females. At the same age, this risk ranged from 51{\%} for APOE44 male carriers to 60{\%} for APOE44 female carriers, and from 23{\%} for APOE34 male carriers to 30{\%} for APOE34 female carriers, consistent with semi-dominant inheritance of a moderately penetrant gene. Using PAQUID (France) incidence data, estimates were globally similar except that at age 85 the LTRs reached 68 and 35{\%} for APOE 44 and APOE 34 female carriers, respectively. These risks are more similar to those of major genes in Mendelian diseases, such as BRCA1 in breast cancer, than those of low-risk common alleles identified by recent GWAS in complex diseases. In addition, stratification of our data by age groups clearly demonstrates that APOE4 is a risk factor not only for late-onset but for early-onset AD as well. Together, these results urge a reappraisal of the impact of APOE in Alzheimer disease.},

In many cases, there is no means of achieving the superficially appealing goal of "correcting" or "controlling for" real group differences on a potential covariate. In hopes of curtailing misuse of ANCOVA and promoting appropriate use, a nontechnical discussion is provided, emphasizing a substantive confound rarely articulated in textbooks and other general presentations, to complement the mathematical critiques already available.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Agitation/aggression in Alzheimer disease (AD) is a major cause of patient distress, caregiver burden, and institutionalization. Enhanced behavioral responsiveness to central nervous system norepinephrine (NE) release may contribute to the pathophysiology of agitation/aggression in AD. Prazosin, a nonsedating generic medication used for hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy, antagonizes NE effects at brain postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoreceptors. This pilot study examined the efficacy and tolerability of prazosin for behavioral symptoms in patients with agitation/aggression in AD.

DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study.

SETTING: A university AD center and a nursing home in Seattle, WA.

PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two nursing home and community-dwelling participants with agitation/aggression and probable or possible AD (mean age: 80.6 +/- 11.2).

INTERVENTION: Randomization to placebo (N = 11) or prazosin (N = 11). Medication was initiated at 1 mg/day and increased up to 6 mg/day using a flexible dosing algorithm.

MEASUREMENTS: The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) at Week 8.

RESULTS: Participants taking prazosin (mean dose: 5.7 +/- 0.9 mg/day) had greater improvements than those taking placebo (mean dose: 5.6 +/- 1.2 mg/day) on the NPI (mean change: -19 +/- 21 versus -2 +/- 15, chi = 6.32, df = 1, p = 0.012) and BPRS (mean change: -9 +/- 9 versus -3 +/- 5, chi = 4.42, df = 1, p = 0.036) based on linear mixed effects models and the CGIC (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.0 versus 4.5 +/- 1.6, z = 2.57, p = 0.011 [Mann-Whitney test]). Adverse effects and blood pressure changes were similar between prazosin and placebo groups.

CONCLUSION: Prazosin was well tolerated and improved behavioral symptoms in patients with agitation/aggression in AD.},

@article{Yaffe2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although several risk factors for cognitive decline have been identified, much less is known about factors that predict maintenance of cognitive function in advanced age.

METHODS: We studied 2,509 well-functioning black and white elders enrolled in a prospective study. Cognitive function was measured using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination at baseline and years 3, 5, and 8. Random effects models were used to classify participants as cognitive maintainers (cognitive change slope {\textgreater} or = 0), minor decliners (slope {\textless} 0 and {\textgreater} 1 SD below mean), or major decliners (slope {\textless} or = 1 SD below mean). Logistic regression was used to identify domain-specific factors associated with being a maintainer vs a minor decliner.

RESULTS: Over 8 years, 30{\%} of the participants maintained cognitive function, 53{\%} showed minor decline, and 16{\%} had major cognitive decline. In the multivariate model, baseline variables significantly associated with being a maintainer vs a minor decliner were age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.65, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.77 per 5 years), white race (OR = 1.72, 95{\%} CI 1.30-2.28), high school education level or greater (OR = 2.75, 95{\%} CI 1.78-4.26), ninth grade literacy level or greater (OR = 4.85, 95{\%} CI 3.00-7.87), weekly moderate/vigorous exercise (OR = 1.31, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.62), and not smoking (OR = 1.84, 95{\%} CI 1.14-2.97). Variables associated with major cognitive decline compared to minor cognitive decline are reported.

CONCLUSION: Elders who maintain cognitive function have a unique profile that differentiates them from those with minor decline. Importantly, some of these factors are modifiable and thus may be implemented in prevention programs to promote successful cognitive aging. Further, factors associated with maintenance may differ from factors associated with major cognitive decline, which may impact prevention vs treatment strategies.},

Composite measures that assess changes in episodic memory, executive function, global cognition, and global function have recently been developed by a number of groups and appear to be sensitive at this stage. Functional measures that involve real-life complex tasks also appear to capture early subtle changes in pre-dementia subjects and have the advantage of representing clinically meaningful change. Patient reported outcomes and novel CSF and imaging biomarkers have also shown promise. More studies are needed to validate all of these tests in the pre-dementia population.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: 100 years after the first description, Alzheimer's disease is one of the most disabling and burdensome health conditions worldwide. We used the Delphi consensus method to determine dementia prevalence for each world region.

METHODS: 12 international experts were provided with a systematic review of published studies on dementia and were asked to provide prevalence estimates for every WHO world region, for men and women combined, in 5-year age bands from 60 to 84 years, and for those aged 85 years and older. UN population estimates and projections were used to estimate numbers of people with dementia in 2001, 2020, and 2040. We estimated incidence rates from prevalence, remission, and mortality.

FINDINGS: Evidence from well-planned, representative epidemiological surveys is scarce in many regions. We estimate that 24.3 million people have dementia today, with 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year (one new case every 7 seconds). The number of people affected will double every 20 years to 81.1 million by 2040. Most people with dementia live in developing countries (60{\%} in 2001, rising to 71{\%} by 2040). Rates of increase are not uniform; numbers in developed countries are forecast to increase by 100{\%} between 2001 and 2040, but by more than 300{\%} in India, China, and their south Asian and western Pacific neighbours.

INTERPRETATION: We believe that the detailed estimates in this paper constitute the best currently available basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources.},

abstract = {Background: Eighteen-month-long randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are common for phase II and phase III drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, no 18-month trial has shown statistically significant outcomes favoring the test drug. We examined characteristics and underlying assumptions of these trials by assessing the placebo groups. Methods: We searched the clinicaltrials.gov registry for randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials for AD of at least 18-month duration and extracted demographic, clinical, and trials characteristics, and change in main outcomes from the placebo groups. We obtained additional information from presentations, abstracts, publications, and sponsors. Results: Of 23 trials identified, 11 were completed and had baseline data available; nine had follow-up data available; 17 were phase III. General inclusion criteria were very similar except that minimum Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores varied from 12 to 20. Sample sizes ranged from 402 to 1,684 for phase III trials and 80 to 400 for phase II. Cholinesterase inhibitor use was from 53{\%} to 100{\%}, and memantine use was from 13.5{\%} to 78{\%}. The AD Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) was the co-primary outcome in all trials; and activities of daily living, global severity, or global change ratings were the other co-primaries. APOE ??4 genotype carriers ranged from 58{\%} to 67{\%}; mean baseline ADAS-cog was 17.8 to 24.2. ADAS-cog worsening in the placebo groups during 18 months ranged from 4.34 to 9.10, with standard deviations from 8.17 to 9.39, increasing during 18 months. Conclusions: Inclusion criteria are essentially similar to earlier 6-month and 12-month trials in which cholinesterase inhibitors were not allowed, as were mean ADAS-cog rates of change. Yet increasing variability and relatively little change overall in the ADAS-cog placebo groups, eg, about 25{\%} of patients do not worsen by more than 1 point, might make it more unlikely than previously assumed that a modestly effective drug can be reliably recognized, especially when the drug might work only to attenuate decline in function and not to improve function. These observations would be strengthened by pooling individual trials data, and pharmaceutical sponsors should participate in such efforts. ?? 2009 The Alzheimer's Association.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health care planning and research would benefit from tools that enable researchers to project the future burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and evaluate the effect of potential interventions. METHODS: We created a web-based application of the AD prevalence model developed by Brookmeyer et al (Am J Public Health 1998;88:1337-42; Alzheimers Dement 2007;3:186-91). The user defines the disease parameters and any interventions that may either reduce risk or slow disease progression. We expanded the parameters to include the cost and weights for disability-adjusted life years. APPLICATION: The secure, web-based application generates detailed AD projections for each calendar year to 2050, and allows users to create personal accounts for them to save, retrieve, and modify the input parameters. The flexibility of the application is illustrated with a forecast for the state of Maryland, USA. CONCLUSIONS: The application generates AD burden projections, costs, and disability-adjusted life years, along with changes associated with potential interventions.},

abstract = {Complete randomization, the simplest method for allocating treatments to patients in clinical trials, can serve as a basis for inferential procedures using standard permutation tests, because the method ensures that each sequence of allocations is equally likely. No other method of allocation possesses this property. However, many clinical trials employ allocation methods that force balance of covariates across treatment groups. With these methods, some allocation sequences are impossible or highly unlikely so that standard permutation tests are technically invalidated. In this article we investigate whether standard permutation tests for binary outcomes are likely to yield distorted nominal p values in practical applications of these alternative allocation methods. A sample of completed trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group serves as a basis on which to construct simulations. Our results indicate that nominal p values can be conservative, but are not likely to be severely distorted if the analysis is stratified by important covariates used as allocation prompts. Moreover the inherent conservativeness of exact methods due to discreteness tends to dominate any additional conservativeness due to nonrandom designs. In addition, we investigate the relationship of treatment allocation methods with bias in estimates from a logistic model when important covariates are unknown. This bias is the same for all asymptotically balanced allocation methods and is significant but not disastrous.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an unsupervised algorithm for learning a finite mixture model from multivariate data. The adjective "unsupervised" is justified by two properties of the algorithm: 1) it is capable of selecting the number of components and 2) unlike the standard expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, it does not require careful initialization. The proposed method also avoids another drawback of EM for mixture fitting: the possibility of convergence toward a singular estimate at the boundary of the parameter space. The novelty of our approach is that we do not use a model selection criterion to choose one among a set of preestimated candidate models; instead, we seamlessly integrate estimation and model selection in a single algorithm. Our technique can be applied to any involving Gaussian mixtures. These experiments testify for the good performance of our approach.},

abstract = {In recent years, the role of PET imaging in the prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion has been the subject of many longitudinal studies. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of (18) F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and (11) C-Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) for prediction of short-term conversion to AD in patients with MCI. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for relevant studies. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed. Sensitivities and specificities of PET in individual studies were calculated and meta-analysis was undertaken with a random-effects model. A summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed with the Moses-Shapiro-Littenberg method. Heterogeneity was tested, and the presence of publication bias was assessed. Potential sources for heterogeneity were explored by assessing whether or not certain covariates significantly influenced the relative diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), DOR and the SROC curve of each PET imaging were determined. A total of 13 research studies (seven FDG-PET and six PIB-PET) met inclusion criteria and had sufficient data for statistical analysis. FDG-PET pooled estimates had 78.7{\%} sensitivity (95{\%} CI, 68.7-86.6{\%}),74.0{\%} specificity (95{\%} CI, 67.0-80.3{\%}), 18.1 LR+(95{\%} CI, 7.3-45.0) and 0.32 LR-(95{\%} CI, 0.16-0.61); and PIB-PET pooled estimates had 93.5{\%} sensitivity (95{\%}CI, 71.3-99.9{\%}), 56.2{\%} specificity (95{\%} CI, 47.2-64.8{\%}), 2.01 LR+ (95{\%} CI, 1.57-2.58) and 0.17 LR-(95{\%} CI, 0.08-0.36). Overall DOR was 17.3 (95{\%} CI, 5.08-59.2) for FDG-PET and 12.8 (95{\%} CI, 5.35-30.54) for PIB-PET. Area under the SROC curve was 0.88 ± 0.05 for FDG-PET and 0.85 ± 0.04 for PIB-PET. The data from FDG-PET research studies had high heterogeneity and funnel plot suggested a publication bias. The diagnostic accuracy determined for both FDG-PET and PIB-PET in this meta-analysis suggests that they are potentially valuable techniques for prediction of progression in patients with MCI. Both have their advantages and their combined use is a promising option for prediction purposes depending on availability and experience.},

This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot 2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar M learn how to create graphical "poems." Supplemental materials are available online.},

abstract = {Testing genetic markers for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) is an important tool for detecting genotyping errors in large-scale genotyping studies. For markers at the X chromosome, typically the $\chi$2 or exact test is applied to the females only, and the hemizygous males are considered to be uninformative. In this paper we show that the males are relevant, because a difference in allele frequency between males and females may indicate HWE not to hold. The testing of markers on the X chromosome has received little attention, and in this paper we lay down the foundation for testing biallelic X-chromosomal markers for HWE. We develop four frequentist statistical test procedures for X-linked markers that take both males and females into account: the $\chi$2 test, likelihood ratio test, exact test and permutation test. Exact tests that include males are shown to have a better Type I error rate. Empirical data from the GENEVA project on venous thromboembolism is used to illustrate the proposed tests. Results obtained with the new tests differ substantially from tests that are based on female genotype counts only. The new tests detect differences in allele frequencies and seem able to uncover additional genotyping error that would have gone unnoticed in HWE tests based on females only.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Baseline data collected on each patient at randomisation in controlled clinical trials can be used to describe the population of patients, to assess comparability of treatment groups, to achieve balanced randomisation, to adjust treatment comparisons for prognostic factors, and to undertake subgroup analyses. We assessed the extent and quality of such practices in major clinical trial reports.

METHODS: A sample of 50 consecutive clinical-trial reports was obtained from four major medical journals during July to September, 1997. We tabulated the detailed information on uses of baseline data by use of a standard form.

FINDINGS: Most trials presented baseline comparability in a table. These tables were often unduly large, and about half the trials inappropriately used significance tests for baseline comparison. Methods of randomisation, including possible stratification, were often poorly described. There was little consistency over whether to use covariate adjustment and the criteria for selecting baseline factors for which to adjust were often unclear. Most trials emphasised the simple unadjusted results and covariate adjustment usually made negligible difference. Two-thirds of the reports presented subgroup findings, but mostly without appropriate statistical tests for interaction. Many reports put too much emphasis on subgroup analyses that commonly lacked statistical power.

INTERPRETATION: Clinical trials need a predefined statistical analysis plan for uses of baseline data, especially covariate-adjusted analyses and subgroup analyses. Investigators and journals need to adopt improved standards of statistical reporting, and exercise caution when drawing conclusions from subgroup findings.},

abstract = {Treatment of degenerating basal forebrain cholinergic neurons with nerve growth factor (NGF) in Alzheimer's disease has long been contemplated, but an effective and safe delivery method has been lacking. Towards achieving this goal, we are currently developing CERE-110, an adeno-associated virus-based gene delivery vector that encodes for human NGF, for stereotactic surgical delivery to the human nucleus basalis of Meynert. Results indicate that NGF transgene delivery to the targeted brain region via CERE-110 is reliable and accurate, that NGF transgene distribution can be controlled by altering CERE-110 dose, and that it is possible to achieve restricted NGF expression limited to but covering the target brain region. Results from animals examined at longer time periods of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after CERE-110 delivery indicate that NGF transgene expression is stable and sustained at all time points, with no loss or build-up of protein over the long-term. In addition, results from a series of experiments indicate that CERE-110 is neuroprotective and neurorestorative to basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the rat fimbria-fornix lesion and aged rat models, and has bioactive effects on young rat basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. These findings, as well as those from several additional non-clinical experiments conducted in both rats and monkeys, led to the initiation of a Phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CERE-110 in Alzheimer's disease subjects, which is currently ongoing.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of memory impairment and dementia in the elderly. AD is pathologically characterized by extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptide, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, neuronal loss, and neurotransmitter dysfunction. Clinically, AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline that usually starts with memory impairment and progresses to cause a more generalized cognitive dysfunction, behavioral dysregulation, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. These symptoms collectively lead to a progressive and relentless decline in the ability to perform functions of daily living, eventually leading to total incapacitation. The incidence and prevalence of AD are expected to exponentially increase with the aging of the population. Currently approved treatments, including the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist memantine, do not halt the progression of the disease, and have provided marginal therapeutic benefits. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop novel and effective medications for AD that go beyond AChEIs and NMDA antagonists. Modern research has focused on discovering effective disease-modifying therapies, which specifically target the pathophysiologic cascade, hoping to delay the onset of the disease and slow its progression. In this review, different pharmacological drugs and therapeutic approaches will be discussed, with an emphasis on novel therapies that are currently being investigated in clinical trials.},

Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to dementia and the associated biosignatures has recently received increasing attention in AD research. Different biosignatures for AD (neuroimaging, demographic, genetic and cognitive measures) may contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis of AD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We have conducted a comprehensive study using a large number of samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test the power of integrating various baseline data for predicting the conversion from MCI to probable AD and identifying a small subset of biosignatures for the prediction and assess the relative importance of different modalities in predicting MCI to AD conversion. We have employed sparse logistic regression with stability selection for the integration and selection of potential predictors. Our study differs from many of the other ones in three important respects: (1) we use a large cohort of MCI samples that are unbiased with respect to age or education status between case and controls (2) we integrate and test various types of baseline data available in ADNI including MRI, demographic, genetic and cognitive measures and (3) we apply sparse logistic regression with stability selection to ADNI data for robust feature selection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have used 319 MCI subjects from ADNI that had MRI measurements at the baseline and passed quality control, including 177 MCI Non-converters and 142 MCI Converters. Conversion was considered over the course of a 4-year follow-up period. A combination of 15 features (predictors) including those from MRI scans, APOE genotyping, and cognitive measures achieves the best prediction with an AUC score of 0.8587.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the power of integrating various baseline data for prediction of the conversion from MCI to probable AD. Our results also demonstrate the effectiveness of stability selection for feature selection in the context of sparse logistic regression.},

abstract = {Sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common age related cerebral small vessel disease, characterised by progressive deposition of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) in the wall of small to medium sized arteries, arterioles and capillaries of the cerebral cortex and overlying leptomeninges. Previously considered to be a rare neurological curiosity, CAA is now recognised as an important cause of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage and cognitive impairment in the elderly, two fundamental challenges in the field of cerebrovascular disease. Our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of CAA continues to evolve rapidly, with the use of transgenic mouse models and advanced structural and/or molecular neuroimaging techniques. Yet, despite remarkable recent interest, CAA remains under-recognised by neurologists and stroke physicians. In this review, a fresh look at key developments in understanding the complex pathophysiology, important clinical and radiological features, diagnostic approaches and prospects for rational therapies for this enigmatic small vessel disorder is provided.},

The PBTC was created in 1999 to conduct early-phase studies in a rapid fashion in order to provide sound scientific foundation for the Children's Oncology Group to conduct definitive trials. The Operations and Biostatistics Center (OBC) of the PBTC is responsible for centrally administering study design and trial development, study conduct and monitoring, data collection and management as well as various regulatory and compliance processes. The phase I designs utilized for the consortium trials have accommodated challenges unique to pediatric trials such as body surface area (BSA)-based dosing in the absence of pediatric formulations of oral agents. Further during the past decade, the OBC has developed and implemented a state-of-the-art secure and efficient internet-based paperless distributed data management system. Additional web-based systems are also in place for tracking and distributing correlative study data as well as neuroimaging files. These systems enable effective communications among the members of the consortium and facilitate the conduct and timely reporting of multi-institutional early-phase clinical trials.},

abstract = {Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) techniques are often employed in the analysis of clinical trials to try to account for the effects of varying pretreatment baseline values of an outcome variable on posttreatment measurements of the same variable. Baseline measurements of outcome variables are typically random variables, which violates the usual ANCOVA assumption that covariate values are fixed. Therefore, the usual ANCOVA hypothesis tests of treatment effects may be invalid, and the ANCOVA slope parameter estimator biased, for this application. We show, however, that if the pretreatment - posttreatment measurements have a bivariate normal distribution, then (i) the ANCOVA model with residual error independent of the covariate is a valid expression of the relationship between pretreatment and posttreatment measurements; (ii) the usual (fixed-covariate analysis) ANCOVA estimates of the slope parameter and treatment effect contrasts are unbiased; and (iii) the usual ANCOVA treatment effect contrast t-tests are valid significance tests for treatment effects. Moreover, as long as the magnitudes of the treatment effects do not depend on the "true" pretreatment value of the outcome variable, the true slope parameter must lie in the interval (0, 1) and the ANCOVA model has a clear interpretation as an adjustment (based on between- and within-subject variability) to an analysis of variance model applied to the posttreatment-pretreatment differences.},

This paper describes new algorithms for sampling from the conditional distribution, given a sufficient statistic, for discrete exponen-tial families.

The tutorial reviews key concepts in multiple hypothesis testing and introduces main classes of methods for addressing multiplicity in a clinical trial setting. General guidelines for the development of relevant and efficient multiple testing procedures are presented on the basis of application-specific clinical and statistical information. Case studies with common multiplicity problems are used to motivate and illustrate the statistical methods presented in the tutorial, and software implementation of the multiplicity adjustment methods is discussed.

abstract = {AIM: To estimate the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias in the USA using a nationally representative sample.

METHODS: The Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study sample was composed of 856 individuals aged 71 years and older from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) who were evaluated for dementia using a comprehensive in-home assessment. An expert consensus panel used this information to assign a diagnosis of normal cognition, cognitive impairment but not demented, or dementia (and dementia subtype). Using sampling weights derived from the HRS, we estimated the national prevalence of dementia, AD and vascular dementia by age and gender.

RESULTS: The prevalence of dementia among individuals aged 71 and older was 13.9{\%}, comprising about 3.4 million individuals in the USA in 2002. The corresponding values for AD were 9.7{\%} and 2.4 million individuals. Dementia prevalence increased with age, from 5.0{\%} of those aged 71-79 years to 37.4{\%} of those aged 90 and older.

CONCLUSIONS: Dementia prevalence estimates from this first nationally representative population-based study of dementia in the USA to include subjects from all regions of the country can provide essential information for effective planning for the impending healthcare needs of the large and increasing number of individuals at risk for dementia as our population ages.},

abstract = {Normal aging is associated with a significant reduction in cognitive function across primate species. However, the structural and molecular basis for this age-related decline in neural function has yet to be defined clearly. Extensive cell loss does not occur as a consequence of normal aging in human and nonhuman primate species. More recent studies have demonstrated significant reductions in functional neuronal markers in subcortical brain regions in primates as a consequence of aging, including dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, although corresponding losses in cortical innervation from these neurons have not been investigated. In the present study, we report that aging is associated with a significant 25{\%} reduction in cortical innervation by cholinergic systems in rhesus monkeys (P {\textless} 0.001). Further, these age-related reductions are ameliorated by cellular delivery of human nerve growth factor to cholinergic somata in the basal forebrain, restoring levels of cholinergic innervation in the cortex to those of young monkeys (P = 0.89). Thus, (i) aging is associated with a significant reduction in cortical cholinergic innervation; (ii) this reduction is reversible by growth-factor delivery; and (iii) growth factors can remodel axonal terminal fields at a distance, representing a nontropic action of growth factors in modulating adult neuronal structure and function (i.e., administration of growth factors to cholinergic somata significantly increases axon density in terminal fields). These findings are relevant to potential clinical uses of growth factors to treat neurological disorders.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of rivastigmine in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on the time to clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the rate of cognitive decline.

METHODS: The study was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of up to 48 months. All patients had MCI operationally defined by having cognitive symptoms, a global clinical dementia rating stage of 0.5, a score of less than 9 on the New York University delayed paragraph recall test, and by not meeting the diagnostic criteria for AD. Primary efficacy variables were time to clinical diagnosis of AD, and change in performance on a cognitive test battery. This study is registered with the US National Institutes of Health clinical trials database (ClinicalTrials.gov), number NCT00000174.

FINDINGS: Of 1018 study patients enrolled, 508 were randomly assigned to rivastigmine and 510 to placebo; 17.3{\%} of patients on rivastigmine and 21.4{\%} on placebo progressed to AD (hazard ratio 0.85 [95{\%} CI 0.64-1.12]; p=0.225). There was no significant difference between the rivastigmine and placebo groups on the standardised Z score for the cognitive test battery measured as mean change from baseline to endpoint (-0.10 [95{\%} CI -0.63 to 0.44], p=0.726). Serious adverse events were reported by 141 (27.9{\%}) rivastigmine-treated patients and 155 (30.5{\%}) patients on placebo; adverse events of all types were reported by 483 (95.6{\%}) rivastigmine-treated patients and 472 (92.7{\%}) placebo-treated patients. The predominant adverse events were cholinergic: the frequencies of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and dizziness were two to four times higher in the rivastigmine group than in the placebo group.

INTERPRETATION: There was no significant benefit of rivastigmine on the progression rate to AD or on cognitive function over 4 years. The overall rate of progression from MCI to AD in this randomised clinical trial was much lower than predicted. Rivastigmine treatment was not associated with any significant safety concerns.},

However, despite much hope, the hypothesis remains unproven. Although the results from the first small clinical trial with an anti-inflammatory agent in Alzheimer's disease appeared promising, subsequent trials with a variety of anti-inflammatory agents have failed to show beneficial effects. There are many potential reasons for this including drug selection, drug dose, timing and duration of treatment. This article reviews evidence in support of the inflammatory hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease, as well as the progress of clinical trials using specific anti-inflammatory treatment regimens.

Objective To characterize and quantify the risk for Alzheimer-related cognitive decline among cognitively normal individuals with elevated brain amyloid. Design, Setting, and Participants Exploratory analyses were conducted with longitudinal cognitive and biomarker data from 445 cognitively normal individuals in the United States and Canada. Participants were observed from August 23, 2005, to June 7, 2016, for a median of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 2.0-4.2 years; maximum follow-up, 10.3 years) as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Exposures Individuals were classified at baseline as having normal (n = 243) or elevated (n = 202) brain amyloid using positron emission tomography amyloid imaging or a cerebrospinal fluid assay of amyloid $\beta$. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included scores on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC; a sum of 4 baseline standardized z scores, which decreases with worse performance), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 0 [worst] to 30 [best] points), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum of Boxes; 0 [best] to 18 [worst] points), and Logical Memory Delayed Recall (0 [worst] to 25 [best] story units). Results Among the 445 participants (243 with normal amyloid, 202 with elevated amyloid), mean (SD) age was 74.0 (5.9) years, mean education was 16.4 (2.7) years, and 52{\%} were women. The mean score for PACC at baseline was 0.00 (2.60); for MMSE, 29.0 (1.2); for CDR-Sum of Boxes, 0.04 (0.14); and for Logical Memory Delayed Recall, 13.1 (3.3). Compared with the group with normal amyloid, those with elevated amyloid had worse mean scores at 4 years on the PACC (mean difference, 1.51 points [95{\%} CI, 0.94-2.10]; P {\textless} .001), MMSE (mean difference, 0.56 points [95{\%} CI, 0.32-0.80]; P {\textless} .001), and CDR-Sum of Boxes (mean difference, 0.23 points [95{\%} CI, 0.08-0.38]; P = .002). For Logical Memory Delayed Recall, between-group score was not statistically significant at 4 years (mean difference, 0.73 story units [95{\%} CI, -0.02 to 1.48]; P = .056). Conclusions and Relevance Exploratory analyses of a cognitively normal cohort followed up for a median of 3.1 years suggest that elevation in baseline brain amyloid level, compared with normal brain amyloid level, was associated with higher likelihood of cognitive decline, although the findings are of uncertain clinical significance. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of these differences and measure longer-term associations.},

abstract = {Inflammation may be an important mechanism underlying dementia and cognitive decline in the elderly. Inflammation has been implicated in the neuropathological cascade leading to the development of Alzheimer's disease and other common forms of dementia in later life. These observations have led to observational epidemiological study to define the association of systemic and brain inflammatory markers on cognitive impairment and dementia. Furthermore, clinical trials have been carried out to better elucidate the possible role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the prevention or slowing of progression of Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we discuss the observational epidemiological and clinical trial evidence of the role of inflammation on the occurrence and prevention of dementia or cognitive decline. NSAIDs hold promise to prevent dementia if given in an appropriate time window during the induction phase of dementia and to subjects with apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 alleles. Also, immunotherapy may prove beneficial.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, are associated with changes in multiple neuroimaging and biological measures. These may provide complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. We present a multi-modality classification framework in which manifolds are constructed based on pairwise similarity measures derived from random forest classifiers. Similarities from multiple modalities are combined to generate an embedding that simultaneously encodes information about all the available features. Multi-modality classification is then performed using coordinates from this joint embedding. We evaluate the proposed framework by application to neuroimaging and biological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Features include regional MRI volumes, voxel-based FDG-PET signal intensities, CSF biomarker measures, and categorical genetic information. Classification based on the joint embedding constructed using information from all four modalities out-performs the classification based on any individual modality for comparisons between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, as well as between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. Based on the joint embedding, we achieve classification accuracies of 89{\%} between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, and 75{\%} between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. These results are comparable with those reported in other recent studies using multi-kernel learning. Random forests provide consistent pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities, thus facilitating the combination of different types of feature data. We demonstrate this by application to data in which the number of features differs by several orders of magnitude between modalities. Random forest classifiers extend naturally to multi-class problems, and the framework described here could be applied to distinguish between multiple patient groups in the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) appeared to be a promising target for disease-modifying therapeutic strategies like passive immunotherapy with anti-A$\beta$ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Biochemical markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) include alterations of A$\beta$ that allow the diagnosis of AD. Biomarker strategies, such as the levels of A$\beta$ in CSF and plasma, currently play an important role in early clinical trials for AD. Indeed, these strategies have a relevant impact on the outcome of such studies, since the biomarkers are used to monitor the bioactivity of anti-A$\beta$ mAbs. The clinical trials of Solanezumab were mainly based on the readout of A$\beta$ levels in CSF and plasma, whereas those of Bapineuzumab were based on cognition; however, little is known about the mechanisms altering these biomarker levels, and no biomarker has yet been proven to be a successful predictor for AD therapy. In addition, the A$\beta$ biomarkers allow for the determination of free and bound anti-A$\beta$ mAb in order to monitor the available amount of bioactive drug and could give hints to the mechanism of action. In this review, we discuss clinical A$\beta$ biomarker data and the latest regulatory strategies.},

abstract = {The effects of normal aging on the primate brain are incompletely understood. Although both human and nonhuman primates demonstrate clear functional declines in selective attention, "executive" functions, and some components of declarative memory with aging, most studies have failed to demonstrate extensive neuronal atrophy or loss as a substrate for these degenerative changes in primates. In particular, extensive age-related neuronal loss in memory-related brain regions such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex has not been found. However, it is possible that neuronal loss or atrophy might occur in subcortical nuclei that modulate the activity of neocortical regions, thereby accounting for altered cognitive function with aging. In the present study, we describe, to our knowledge for the first time, a significant and extensive decline in the number and size of immunolabeled neurons in subcortical cholinergic basal forebrain regions of aged rhesus monkeys, the best animal model of human aging, by using stereological methods. Notably, the loss of subcortical cholinergic neuronal markers in aged monkeys was nearly completely reversed by human nerve growth factor gene delivery. These findings (i) identify reversible cellular atrophy as a potential mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive decline in primates, (ii) suggest, when considered with other studies, that subcortical brain regions exhibit greater vulnerability to the effects of aging than cortical regions, and (iii) indicate that neurotrophin gene transfer may be an effective means of preventing neuronal atrophy or degeneration in age-related neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {Although missing outcome data are an important problem in randomized trials and observational studies, methods to address this issue can be difficult to apply. Using simulated data, the authors compared 3 methods to handle missing outcome data: 1) complete case analysis; 2) single imputation; and 3) multiple imputation (all 3 with and without covariate adjustment). Simulated scenarios focused on continuous or dichotomous missing outcome data from randomized trials or observational studies. When outcomes were missing at random, single and multiple imputations yielded unbiased estimates after covariate adjustment. Estimates obtained by complete case analysis with covariate adjustment were unbiased as well, with coverage close to 95{\%}. When outcome data were missing not at random, all methods gave biased estimates, but handling missing outcome data by means of 1 of the 3 methods reduced bias compared with a complete case analysis without covariate adjustment. Complete case analysis with covariate adjustment and multiple imputation yield similar estimates in the event of missing outcome data, as long as the same predictors of missingness are included. Hence, complete case analysis with covariate adjustment can and should be used as the analysis of choice more often. Multiple imputation, in addition, can accommodate the missing-not-at-random scenario more flexibly, making it especially suited for sensitivity analyses.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing. RESULTS: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.},

Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

Although exact methods would be preferred in these situations, it generally is believed that such methods are computationally intractable. We propose methods for calculating exact distributions and significance levels for goodness-of-fit statistics that are computationally feasible over a wide range of models. In particular, the distribution for a simple multinomial model can be evaluated in polynomial time. For composite null hypotheses, we calculate the distribution conditional on the sufficient statistics for the nuisance parameters. We calculate the characteristic function of a distribution and invert the characteristic function using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Our approach emphasizes the relationship between exact methods and probability formulas. Our technique, transforming the domain of the problem, is interesting for two reasons: First, algorithms that use the FFT and the convolution theorem are efficient for calculating the distribution of sums of independent statistics; and second, less storage is needed when working in the frequency domain than in the probability domain. The algorithms can be applied to general goodness-of-fit statistics and are parallelizable.},

abstract = {Introduction Solanezumab is an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in clinical testing for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its mechanism suggests the possibility of slowing the progression of AD. Methods A possible disease-modifying effect of solanezumab was assessed using a new statistical method including noninferiority testing. Performance differences were compared during the placebo-controlled period with performance differences after the placebo patients crossed over to solanezumab in the delayed-start period. Results Noninferiority of the 14-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog14) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living inventory instrumental items (ADCS-iADL) differences was met through 132 weeks, indicating that treatment differences observed in the placebo-controlled period remained, within a predefined margin, after the placebo group initiated solanezumab. Solanezumab was well tolerated, and no new safety concerns were identified. Discussion The results of this secondary analysis show that the mild subgroup of solanezumab-treated patients who initiated treatment early, at the start of the placebo-controlled period, retained an advantage at most time points in the delayed-start period.},

@article{Bretz2005,
abstract = {The analysis of data from dose-response studies has long been divided according to two major strategies: multiple comparison procedures and model-based approaches. Model-based approaches assume a functional relationship between the response and the dose, taken as a quantitative factor, according to a prespecified parametric model. The fitted model is then used to estimate an adequate dose to achieve a desired response but the validity of its conclusions will highly depend on the correct choice of the a priori unknown dose-response model. Multiple comparison procedures regard the dose as a qualitative factor and make very few, if any, assumptions about the underlying dose-response model. The primary goal is often to identify the minimum effective dose that is statistically significant and produces a relevant biological effect. One approach is to evaluate the significance of contrasts between different dose levels, while preserving the family-wise error rate. Such procedures are relatively robust but inference is confined to the selection of the target dose among the dose levels under investigation. We describe a unified strategy to the analysis of data from dose-response studies which combines multiple comparison and modeling techniques. We assume the existence of several candidate parametric models and use multiple comparison techniques to choose the one most likely to represent the true underlying dose-response curve, while preserving the family-wise error rate. The selected model is then used to provide inference on adequate doses.},

Within EPAD, the monitoring of cognitive trajectories in the preclinical period will constitute a central outcome measure; however, there are currently no clear guidelines as to how this should be achieved as most measures have been developed for the period around dementia diagnosis. The EPAD Scientific Advisory Group for Clinical and Cognitive Outcomes identified appropriate cognitive measures based on a literature search covering both cognitive correlates of preclinical brain changes from imaging studies and cognitive changes observed over time in nondementia population cohorts developing incident dementia. These measures were evaluated according to the following criteria: validity, coherence with biomarker changes, psychometric properties, cross-cultural suitability, availability of alternative forms, and normative data limited practice effects. The resulting consensus statement provides recommendations for both future drug trials and research into preclinical Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Objective: We compared popular methods to handle missing data with multiple imputation (a more sophisticated method that preserves data). Study Design and Setting: We used data of 804 patients with a suspicion of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). We studied three covariates to predict the presence of DVT: d-dimer level, difference in calf circumference, and history of leg trauma. We introduced missing values (missing at random) ranging from 10{\%} to 90{\%}. The risk of DVT was modeled with logistic regression for the three methods, that is, complete case analysis, exclusion of d-dimer level from the model, and multiple imputation. Results: Multiple imputation showed less bias in the regression coefficients of the three variables and more accurate coverage of the corresponding 90{\%} confidence intervals than complete case analysis and dropping d-dimer level from the analysis. Multiple imputation showed unbiased estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.88) compared with complete case analysis (0.77) and when the variable with missing values was dropped (0.65). Conclusion: As this study shows that simple methods to deal with missing data can lead to seriously misleading results, we advise to consider multiple imputation. The purpose of multiple imputation is not to create data, but to prevent the exclusion of observed data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In research on the determinants of change in health status, a crucial analytic decision is whether to adjust for baseline health status. In this paper, the authors examine the consequences of baseline adjustment, using for illustration the question of the effect of educational attainment on change in cognitive function in old age. With data from the US-based Assets and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old survey (n = 5,726; born before 1924), they show that adjustment for baseline cognitive test score substantially inflates regression coefficient estimates for the effect of schooling on change in cognitive test scores compared with models without baseline adjustment. To explain this finding, they consider various plausible assumptions about relations among variables. Each set of assumptions is represented by a causal diagram. The authors apply simple rules for assessing causal diagrams to demonstrate that, in many plausible situations, baseline adjustment induces a spurious statistical association between education and change in cognitive score. More generally, when exposures are associated with baseline health status, this bias can arise if change in health status preceded baseline assessment or if the dependent variable measurement is unreliable or unstable. In some cases, change-score analyses without baseline adjustment provide unbiased causal effect estimates when baseline-adjusted estimates are biased.},

However, a relatively small reduction or change in lung function - such as those observed in mild to moderate COPD - may not always reflect the impact of the disease or intervention on patients' physical and psychological well-being. This paper examines the utility of various outcome measures that can be used in primary care to monitor and manage COPD. In particular, it demonstrates the importance of measuring patient-centred outcomes, such as health-related quality of life and exacerbations, which may reflect more accurately the effects of the disease and treatment on patients' everyday lives. Recent large-scale clinical trials of budesonide/formoterol and fluticasone/salmeterol combination therapies and tiotropium have utilised these outcome measures to show the significant benefits these treatments bestow to patients in the presence of relatively modest gains in lung function.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people and increasing longevity ensures its prevalence will rise even further. Whether AD originates by disconnecting a localized brain area and propagates to the rest of the brain across disease-severity progression is a question with an unknown answer. An important related challenge is to predict whether a given subject, with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI), will convert or not to AD. Here, our aim is to characterize the structural connectivity pattern of MCI and AD subjects using the multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) analysis, and to compare it to those of healthy subjects. MDMR is a technique developed in genomics that has been recently applied to functional brain network data, and here applied to identify brain nodes with different connectivity patterns, in controls and patients, because of brain atrophy. We address this issue at the macroscale by looking to differences in individual structural MRI brain networks, obtained from MR images according to a recently proposed definition of connectivity which measures the image similarity between patches at different locations in the brain. In particular, using data from ADNI, we selected four groups of subjects (all of them matched by age and sex): HC (healthy control participants), ncMCI (mild cognitive impairment not converting to AD), cMCI (mild cognitive impairment converting to AD) and AD. Next, we built structural MRI brain networks and performed group comparison for all the pairs of groups. Our results were three-fold: (i) considering the comparison of HC with the three other groups, the number of significant brain regions was 4 for ncMCI, 290 for cMCI and 74 for AD, out of a total of 549 regions; hence, in terms of the structural MRI connectivity here adopted, cMCI subjects have the maximal altered pattern w.r.t. healthy conditions. (ii) Eight and seven nodes were significant for the comparisons AD-ncMCI and AD-cMCI, respectively; six nodes, among them, were significant in both comparisons and these nodes form a connected brain region (corresponding to hippocampus, amygdala, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Planum Polare, Frontal Orbital Cortex, Temporal Pole and subcallosal cortex) showing reduced strength of connectivity in the MCI stages; (iii) The connectivity maps of cMCI and ncMCI subjects significantly differ from the connectome of healthy subjects in three regions all corresponding to Frontal Orbital Cortex.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES This review investigates characteristics of implemented adaptive design clinical trials and provides examples of regulatory experience with such trials. DESIGN Review of adaptive design clinical trials in EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Registry of Controlled Clinical Trials, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov. Phase I and seamless Phase I/II trials were excluded. Variables extracted from trials included basic study characteristics, adaptive design features, size and use of independent data monitoring committees (DMCs) and blinded interim analyses. We also examined use of the adaptive trials in new drug submissions to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) and recorded regulators' experiences with adaptive designs. RESULTS 142 studies met inclusion criteria. There has been a recent growth in publicly reported use of adaptive designs among researchers around the world. The most frequently appearing types of adaptations were seamless Phase II/III (57{\%}), group sequential (21{\%}), biomarker adaptive (20{\%}), and adaptive dose-finding designs (16{\%}). About one-third (32{\%}) of trials reported an independent DMC, while 6{\%} reported blinded interim analysis. We found that 9{\%} of adaptive trials were used for FDA product approval consideration, and 12{\%} were used for EMA product approval consideration. International regulators had mixed experiences with adaptive trials. Many product applications with adaptive trials had extensive correspondence between drug sponsors and regulators regarding the adaptive designs, in some cases with regulators requiring revisions or alterations to research designs. CONCLUSIONS Wider use of adaptive designs will necessitate new drug application sponsors to engage with regulatory scientists during planning and conduct of the trials. Investigators need to more consistently report protections intended to preserve confidentiality and minimise potential operational bias during interim analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although covariate adjustment in the analysis of randomised trials can be beneficial, adjustment for continuous covariates is complicated by the fact that the association between covariate and outcome must be specified. Misspecification of this association can lead to reduced power, and potentially incorrect conclusions regarding treatment efficacy. METHODS: We compared several methods of adjustment to determine which is best when the association between covariate and outcome is unknown. We assessed (a) dichotomisation or categorisation; (b) assuming a linear association with outcome; (c) using fractional polynomials with one (FP1) or two (FP2) polynomial terms; and (d) using restricted cubic splines with 3 or 5 knots. We evaluated each method using simulation and through a re-analysis of trial datasets. RESULTS: Methods which kept covariates as continuous typically had higher power than methods which used categorisation. Dichotomisation, categorisation, and assuming a linear association all led to large reductions in power when the true association was non-linear. FP2 models and restricted cubic splines with 3 or 5 knots performed best overall. CONCLUSIONS: For the analysis of randomised trials we recommend (1) adjusting for continuous covariates even if their association with outcome is unknown; (2) keeping covariates as continuous; and (3) using fractional polynomials with two polynomial terms or restricted cubic splines with 3 to 5 knots when a linear association is in doubt.},

abstract = {Adaptive designs that are based on group-sequential approaches have the benefit of being efficient as stopping boundaries can be found that lead to good operating characteristics with test decisions based solely on sufficient statistics. The drawback of these so called 'pre-planned adaptive' designs is that unexpected design changes are not possible without impacting the error rates. 'Flexible adaptive designs' on the other hand can cope with a large number of contingencies at the cost of reduced efficiency. In this work, we focus on two different approaches for multi-arm multi-stage trials, which are based on group-sequential ideas, and discuss how these 'pre-planned adaptive designs' can be modified to allow for flexibility. We then show how the added flexibility can be used for treatment selection and sample size reassessment and evaluate the impact on the error rates in a simulation study. The results show that an impressive overall procedure can be found by combining a well chosen pre-planned design with an application of the conditional error principle to allow flexible treatment selection.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate associations with the distribution of conversion times from mild cognitive impairment to AD. The performances of classifiers developed using data from different types of brain tissue were systematically characterized across cognitive status groups. We also explored the performance of anatomical and cognitive-anatomical composite scores generated by combining the outputs of classifiers developed using different types of data. In addition, we provide the AD-PS scores performance relative to other metrics used in the field including the Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD (SPARE-AD) index and total hippocampal volume for the variables examined.},

abstract = {We sought to develop and evaluate a composite memory score from the neuropsychological battery used in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used modern psychometric approaches to analyze longitudinal Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT, 2 versions), AD Assessment Schedule - Cognition (ADAS-Cog, 3 versions), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Logical Memory data to develop ADNI-Mem, a composite memory score. We compared RAVLT and ADAS-Cog versions, and compared ADNI-Mem to RAVLT recall sum scores, four ADAS-Cog-derived scores, the MMSE, and the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. We evaluated rates of decline in normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, ability to predict conversion from MCI to AD, strength of association with selected imaging parameters, and ability to differentiate rates of decline between participants with and without AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signatures. The second version of the RAVLT was harder than the first. The ADAS-Cog versions were of similar difficulty. ADNI-Mem was slightly better at detecting change than total RAVLT recall scores. It was as good as or better than all of the other scores at predicting conversion from MCI to AD. It was associated with all our selected imaging parameters for people with MCI and AD. Participants with MCI with an AD CSF signature had somewhat more rapid decline than did those without. This paper illustrates appropriate methods for addressing the different versions of word lists, and demonstrates the additional power to be gleaned with a psychometrically sound composite memory score.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: data generated using 'omics' technologies are characterized by high dimensionality, where the number of features measured per subject vastly exceeds the number of subjects in the study. In this paper, we consider issues relevant in the design of biomedical studies in which the goal is the discovery of a subset of features and an associated algorithm that can predict a binary outcome, such as disease status. We compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in high-dimensionality data settings. We evaluate the effects of varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio in the dataset, imbalance in class distribution and choice of metric for quantifying performance of the classifier. To guide study design, we present a summary of the key characteristics of 'omics' data profiled in several human or animal model experiments utilizing high-content mass spectrometry and multiplexed immunoassay based techniques.

RESULTS: the analysis of data from seven 'omics' studies revealed that the average magnitude of effect size observed in human studies was markedly lower when compared to that in animal studies. The data measured in human studies were characterized by higher biological variation and the presence of outliers. The results from simulation studies indicated that the classifier Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) had the highest power when the class conditional feature distributions were Gaussian and outcome distributions were balanced. Random Forests was optimal when feature distributions were skewed and when class distributions were unbalanced. We provide a free open-source R statistical software library (MVpower) that implements the simulation strategy proposed in this paper.

CONCLUSION: no single classifier had optimal performance under all settings. Simulation studies provide useful guidance for the design of biomedical studies involving high-dimensionality data.},

abstract = {Treatment effects are often evaluated by comparing change over time in outcome measures; however, valid analyses of longitudinal data can be problematic, particularly if some data are missing. For decades, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach has been a common method of handling missing data. Considerable advances in statistical methodology and our ability to implement those methods have been made in recent years. Thus, it is appropriate to reconsider analytic approaches for longitudinal data. This review examines the following from a clinical perspective: 1) the characteristics of missing data that influence analytic choices; 2) the attributes of common methods of handling missing data; and 3) the use of the data characteristics and the attributes of the various methods, along with empirical evidence, to develop a robust approach for the analysis and interpretation of data from longitudinal clinical trials. We propose that, in many settings, the primary efficacy analysis should use a repeated measures, likelihood-based, mixed-effects modeling approach, with LOCF used as a secondary, composite measure of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. We illustrate how repeated-measures analyses can be used to enhance decision-making, and we review the caveats that remain regarding the use of LOCF as a composite measure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Over the past few years a number of investigators have studied several plasma biomarkers but most frequently plasma amyloid beta (A$\beta$)40 and A$\beta$42 while others have explored the use of genetic variants as biomarkers for diagnosis or risk. This review considers the cross-sectional and longitudinal data regarding plasma A$\beta$40 and A$\beta$42 as diagnostic biomarkers as well as risk biomarkers. Review of recent genome-wide association studies indicates as many as 10 genetic variants have been associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further analysis suggests that these factors have modest effects on risk and are thus not helpful, as yet, in the diagnosis of disease. Until the function of these genes is understood, their role in risk and diagnosis will remain uncertain. Thus, there are several types of peripheral biomarkers under investigation, but more work is required before they can be deemed clinically useful.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/sim.3055.abs Asymptotic tests such as the Pearson chi-square test are unreliable for testing the homogeneity of two binomial probabilities in extremely unbalanced cases. Two exact tests (conditional and unconditional) are available as alternatives and can be implemented easily in StatXact 6.0. In equal sample cases it is well known that the unconditional exact test is more powerful than the conditional exact test. However, in this paper, we show that the opposite result holds in extremely unbalanced cases. The reason is that the peaks of the type I error occur at the extremes of the nuisance parameter when the imbalance among the sample sizes becomes severe. After we show that the conditional exact test is more powerful than the unconditional exact test in extremely unbalanced cases whose sample ratio is greater than 20, we compare the conditional exact test with the Berger and Boos approach (J. Amer. Stat. Assoc. 1994; 89:1012–1016) in which the supremum is taken over a confidence interval for the nuisance parameter. The Berger and Boos approach turns out to be slightly more powerful than the conditional exact test in extremely unbalanced data. A real example is provided.

@article{Blomqvist1977,
abstract = {Given a series of consecutive measurements on a random sample of individuals, it is often of interest to investigate whether there exists a relationship between the rate of change and the initial value. Assuming that the observations deviate in a random manner from the true values, straightforward regression computations will yield biased results. It is shown that, in the case of the normal distribution, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the second-order moments of the true slope and the true initial value are obtained by simple adjustments of the corresponding moments of the estimated quantities. An asymptotic formula for the standard error of the regression coefficient of slope on initial value is derived, and the methods are applied to longitudinal blood pressure data. The case with concomitant variables is discussed briefly.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether and how longitudinal rates of change in MRI volumetrics, CSF concentrations of Alzheimer-related proteins, molecular imaging of cerebral fibrillar amyloid with PET using the [11 C] benzothiazole tracer, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), and cognition were asso- ciated among asymptomatic middle-aged to older individuals. Methods: Multivariate mixed models for repeated measures were used to assess the correlations on the rates of changes across markers. Results: Among 209 asymptomatic middle-aged to older individuals longitudinally followed for up to 11 years (mean 6.7 years), a faster intraindividual decrease in CSF Ab42 was associatedwith a faster increase in PiB mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio (MCSUVR, p50.04), but not others. The rate of change in CSF tau (and Ptau181) was correlated with the rate of change in PiB MCSUVR (p50.002), hippocampal volume (p50.04), and global cognition (p50.008). The rate of change in hippocampal volume was correlated with the rate of change in global cognition (p 5 0.04). Only 3 significant correlationswere observed at baseline:CSF Ab42 and PiBMCSUVR (p, 0.001), CSF tau and PiB MCSUVR (p , 0.001), and CSF Ab42 and global cognition (p 5 0.01). Conclusions: CSF tau (Ptau181), PiB MCSUVR, and hippocampal volume were all longitudinally correlated with each other, whereas CSF Ab42 was correlated only with PiB binding. Unlike the baseline values, the longitudinal change in CSF tau (Ptau181) and hippocampal volume were cor- related with the longitudinal change in global cognition, validating the role of these biomarkers in Alzheimer disease prevention trials},

abstract = {Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia, the brain's resident phagocyte, are pivotal for the immune response observed in AD. Microglia act as sentinel and protective cells, but may become inappropriately reactive in AD to drive neuropathology. Recent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 gene variants associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD (LOAD), the most prevalent form of AD [1]. The findings strongly implicate genes related to the immune response (CR1, CD33, MS4A, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1 and HLA-DRB5-HLA-DRB1), endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM, CD2AP, EPHA1 and SORL1) and lipid biology (CLU, ABCA7 and SORL1) [2-8], and many encode proteins which are highly expressed in microglia [1]. Furthermore, recent identification of a low frequency mutation in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2) confers increased risk of AD in LOAD cohorts with an effect size similar to that for APOE, until recently the only identified genetic risk factor associated with LOAD [9,10••] (Figure 1). The present review summarises our current understanding of the probable roles of microglial genes in the regulation of neuroinflammatory processes in AD and their relation to other processes affecting the disease's progression.},

Here we explored the utility of automated 3D maps of the lateral ventricles as a possible biomarker of AD. We used our multi-atlas fluid image alignment (MAFIA) method, to compute ventricular models automatically, without user intervention, from 804 brain MRI scans with 184 AD, 391 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 229 healthy elderly controls (446 men, 338 women; age: 75.50 +/- 6.81 [SD] years). Radial expansion of the ventricles, computed pointwise, was strongly correlated with current cognition, depression ratings, Hachinski Ischemic scores, language scores, and with future clinical decline after controlling for any effects of age, gender, and educational level. In statistical maps ranked by effect sizes, ventricular differences were highly correlated with CSF measures of Abeta(1-42), and correlated with ApoE4 genotype. These statistical maps are highly automated, and offer a promising biomarker of AD for large-scale studies.},

A non-pharmacological way to prevent the genotype-induced occurrence of these pathologies is given by dietary behavior. In the present study, we tested the effects of long-term consumption of a specific multi-nutrient diet in two models for atherosclerosis and vascular risk factors in AD: the apolipoprotein $\epsilon$4 (apoE4) and the apoE knockout (apoE ko) mice. This specific multi-nutrient diet was developed to support neuronal membrane synthesis and was expected to contribute to the maintenance of vascular health. At 12 months of age, both genotypes showed behavioral changes compared to control mice and we found increased neurogenesis in apoE ko mice. The specific multi-nutrient diet decreased anxiety-related behavior in the open field, influenced sterol composition in serum and brain tissue, and increased the concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in the brain. Furthermore, we found that wild-type and apoE ko mice fed with this multi-nutrient diet showed locally increased cerebral blood volume and decreased hippocampal glutamate levels. Taken together, these data suggest that a specific dietary intervention has beneficial effects on early pathological consequences of hypercholesterolemia and vascular risk factors for AD.},

abstract = {The common neurodegenerative pathologies underlying dementia are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body disease (LBD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Our aim was to identify patterns of atrophy unique to each of these diseases using antemortem structural MRI scans of pathologically confirmed dementia cases and build an MRI-based differential diagnosis system. Our approach of creating atrophy maps using structural MRI and applying them for classification of new incoming patients is labeled Differential-STAND (Differential Diagnosis Based on Structural Abnormality in Neurodegeneration). Pathologically confirmed subjects with a single dementing pathologic diagnosis who had an MRI at the time of clinical diagnosis of dementia were identified: 48 AD, 20 LBD, 47 FTLD-TDP (pathology-confirmed FTLD with TDP-43). Gray matter density in 91 regions-of-interest was measured in each subject and adjusted for head size and age using a database of 120 cognitively normal elderly. The atrophy patterns in each dementia type when compared to pathologically confirmed controls mirrored known disease-specific anatomic patterns: AD-temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe; FTLD-TDP-frontal and temporal lobes and LBD-bilateral amygdalae, dorsal midbrain and inferior temporal lobes. Differential-STAND based classification of each case was done based on a mixture model generated using bisecting k-means clustering of the information from the MRI scans. Leave-one-out classification showed reasonable performance compared to the autopsy gold standard and clinical diagnosis: AD (sensitivity: 90.7{\%}; specificity: 84{\%}), LBD (sensitivity: 78.6{\%}; specificity: 98.8{\%}) and FTLD-TDP (sensitivity: 84.4{\%}; specificity: 93.8{\%}). The proposed approach establishes a direct a priori relationship between specific topographic patterns on MRI and "gold standard" of pathology which can then be used to predict underlying dementia pathology in new incoming patients.},

abstract = {During the last decade, many novel approaches for addressing multiplicity problems arising in clinical trials have been introduced in the literature. These approaches provide great flexibility in addressing given clinical trial objectives and yet maintain strong control of the familywise error rate. In this tutorial article, we review multiple testing strategies that are related to the following: (a) recycling local significance levels to test hierarchically ordered hypotheses; (b) adapting the significance level for testing a hypothesis to the findings of testing previous hypotheses within a given test sequence, also in view of certain consistency requirements; (c) grouping hypotheses into hierarchical families of hypotheses along with recycling the significance level between those families; and (d) graphical methods that permit repeated recycling of the significance level. These four different methodologies are related to each other, and we point out some connections as we describe and illustrate them. By contrasting the main features of these approaches, our objective is to help practicing statisticians to select an appropriate method for their applications. In this regard, we discuss how to apply some of these strategies to clinical trial settings and provide algorithms to calculate critical values and adjusted p-values for their use in practice. The methods are illustrated with several numerical examples.},

PATIENTS: We followed up 20 MCI subjects clinically and neuropsychologically for 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Baseline regional hippocampal atrophy was analyzed with region-of-interest and 3-dimensional hippocampal mapping techniques. RESULTS: During the 3-year study, 6 patients developed AD (MCI-c), 7 remained stable (MCI-nc), and 7 improved (MCI-i). Patients with MCI-c had 9{\%} smaller left and 13{\%} smaller right mean hippocampal volumes compared with MCI-nc patients. Radial atrophy maps showed greater atrophy of the CA1 subregion in MCI-c. Patients with MCI-c had significantly smaller hippocampi than MCI-i patients (left, 24{\%}; right, 27{\%}). Volumetric analyses showed a trend for greater hippocampal atrophy in MCI-nc relative to MCI-i patients (eg, 16{\%} volume loss). After permutation tests corrected for multiple comparison, the atrophy maps showed a significant difference on the right. Subicular differences were seen between MCI-c and MCI-i patients, and MCI-nc and MCI-i patients. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the group effect to be highly significant and independent of age, hemisphere, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Smaller hippocampi and specifically CA1 and subicular involvement are associated with increased risk for conversion from MCI to AD. Patients with MCI-i tend to have larger hippocampal volumes and relative preservation of both the subiculum and CA1.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with alterations in infant behavior and development that may not be corrected with iron therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if a home-based intervention to foster child development improves behavior and development of infants with IDA.

METHODS: Infants with IDA and nonanemic infants aged 6 and 12 months were treated with oral iron and randomly assigned to a year of surveillance or intervention. Infants in the surveillance group were visited weekly, and information on iron intake, feeding, and health were recorded. Infants in the intervention were visited weekly, and the home visits included an hour-long program to foster child development by providing support to the mother-infant relationship. The number of infants enrolled was 128 (66 who received intervention) and 149 (70 intervention) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Psychologists who were unaware of iron status and intervention assignment assessed infants' cognitive, motor, and social-emotional development (Bayley Scales) at the beginning, midpoint, and end of the year; 116 6-month-olds and 134 12-month-olds had at least 2 assessments. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze change over time.

RESULTS: Infants with IDA, regardless of enrollment age, were rated as less positive in social-emotional behavior at baseline. There were significant interactions between iron status and intervention associated with change in cognitive performance and positive social-emotional behavior. Infants with IDA who received intervention had developmental trajectories comparable to those of nonanemic infants in the intervention and surveillance groups, but these infants did not catch up in social-emotional behavior. Infants with IDA who received surveillance showed less increase in cognitive scores and had declines in positive social-emotional ratings.

CONCLUSIONS: Home-based intervention to foster child development improved cognitive and social-emotional scores in infants with IDA, but social-emotional differences remained between infants with IDA and those without IDA.},

abstract = {Opioids are widely used as effective analgesic therapy for cancer pain. Despite years of controversy, their use has been also accepted in chronic non-cancer pain. Oxycodone alone and in combination has been used for over 80 years in the treatment of a variety of pain syndromes. As single agent, the controlled release (CR) oxycodone's market in the USA grew from 10{\%} in 1996 to 53{\%} in 2000 and it has become a leading opioid in the United States. Recent data showed that the fixed-combination oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg) is the most often prescribed opioid across all the different chronic pain diagnoses. Compared with morphine, oxycodone has a higher oral bioavailability and is about twice as potent. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data support oxycodone as a pharmacologically active opiod that does not require conversion to oxymoprhone for pharmacological activity. Seven studies addressed the safety and efficacy of oxycodone for the treatment of non-cancer pain (low back pain, osteoarthritis pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy). Both immediate release (IR) and CR oxycodone are equally effective and safe. Along these trials, mean daily dosage of oxycodone was approximately 40 mg, with a low incidence of intolerable typical opiate side effects. In cancer pain, oxycodone can be considered a valid alternative to oral morphine to be used for opioid rotation. No difference in analgesic efficacy between CR oxycodone and CR morphine was found. Controlled-release preparations, with a long duration of action, are attractive because they offer the advantage of longer dosing intervals and sustained analgesic effect.},

abstract = {There are many disorders where regulatory agencies have required a new treatment to demonstrate efficacy on multiple co-primary endpoints, all significant at the one-sided 2.5 per cent level, before accepting the treatment's effect for the disorder. This requirement, rooted in the intersection-union (IU) test, has led many researchers to increase the study sample size to make up for the reduction in the statistical power at the study level. Unfortunately, the increase in sample size could be substantial when the endpoints are minimally correlated and the treatment effects on the multiple endpoints are comparable. In this paper, we demonstrate that the frequentist concept of controlling the maximum false positive rate, even when applied to a restricted null space, has only limited success in keeping the sample size increase at a reasonable level. We therefore propose an approach that is based on the notion of controlling an average type I error rate. By employing an upper bound for the average type I error rate, the new approach provides an adjustment to the significance level that depends only on the correlation among the endpoints. For the most common case of two or three co-primary endpoints, the adjusted significance level is at most 5 per cent (one-sided) when the endpoints are moderately correlated. We show how sample size could be calculated under the proposed approach and contrast the needed sample size with that required under the IU test. We provide additional comments and discuss why the new approach is consistent with the principle requiring evidence of significance in the drug development and approval process.},

abstract = {Conditional inference eliminates nuisance parameters by conditioning on their sufficient statistics. For contingency tables conditional inference entails enumerating all tables with the same sufficient statistics as the observed data. For moderately sized tables and/or complex models, the computing time to enumerate these tables is often prohibitive. Monte Carlo approximations offer a viable alternative provided it is possible to obtain samples from the correct conditional distribution. This article presents an MCMC extension of the importance sampling algorithm, using a rounded normal candidate to update randomly chosen cells while leaving the remainder of the table fixed. This local approximation can greatly increase the efficiency of the rounded normal candidate. By choosing the number of cells to be updated at random, a balance is struck between dependency in the Markov chain and accuracy of the candidate. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and Interface Foundation of North America. },

abstract = {Loss of function of TREM2, a key receptor selectively expressed by microglia in the brain, contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We therefore examined whether soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were associated with reduced rates of cognitive decline and clinical progression in subjects with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We measured sTREM2 in CSF samples from 385 elderly subjects, including cognitively normal controls, individuals with MCI, and subjects with AD dementia (follow-up period: mean, 4 years; range 1.5 to 11.5 years). In subjects with AD defined by evidence of CSF A$\beta$1-42 (amyloid $\beta$-peptide 1 to 42; A+) and CSF p-tau181 (tau phosphorylated on amino acid residue 181; T+), higher sTREM2 concentrations in CSF at baseline were associated with attenuated decline in memory and cognition. When analyzed in clinical subgroups, an association between higher CSF sTREM2 concentrations and subsequent reduced memory decline was consistently observed in individuals with MCI or AD dementia, who were positive for CSF A$\beta$1-42 and CSF p-tau181 (A+T+). Regarding clinical progression, a higher ratio of CSF sTREM2 to CSF p-tau181 concentrations predicted slower conversion from cognitively normal to symptomatic stages or from MCI to AD dementia in the subjects who were positive for CSF A$\beta$1-42 and CSF p-tau181. These results suggest that sTREM2 is associated with attenuated cognitive and clinical decline, a finding with important implications for future clinical trials targeting the innate immune response in AD.},

To investigate the centre effects, the variation in the treatment effect must be taken into consideration in addition to the variation in the baseline risk. We treat centre effects as random ones and extend the penalized partial likelihood approach proposed by McGilchrist to estimate the treatment-by-centre interaction as well as the baseline risk. This method is applied to data from a superficial bladder cancer clinical trial investigating the efficacy of intravesical chemotherapy after transurethral resection. In this trial, although there exists some degree of centre variation, especially in the baseline risk, the treatment is effective in preventing recurrence among the participating centres. This result indicates that the treatment effect is generalizable to the target population.},

abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a "research framework" because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or {\textless}i{\textgreater}in vivo{\textless}/i{\textgreater} by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of $\beta$ amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that $\beta$-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD pathogenesis, it is {\textless}b{\textgreater}these abnormal protein deposits{\textless}/b{\textgreater} that {\textless}b{\textgreater}define AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease{\textless}/b{\textgreater} among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Background: We assessed the impact of retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist bexarotene on brain amyloid measured by amyloid imaging in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a proof-of-concept trial. Methods: Twenty patients with AD [Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 10-20 inclusive] with positive florbetapir scans were randomized to receive 300 mg of bexarotene or placebo for 4 weeks. The amyloid imaging result was the primary outcome. Whole-population analyses and prespecified analyses by genotype [apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (ApoE4) carriers and ApoE4 noncarriers] were conducted. Secondary outcomes included scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale, MMSE, Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Serum amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide sequences Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 measurements were collected as biomarker outcomes. Results: There was no change in the composite or regional amyloid burden when all patients were included in the analysis. ApoE4 noncarriers showed a significant reduction in brain amyloid on the composite measure in five of six regional measurements. No change in amyloid burden was observed in ApoE4 carriers. There was a significant association between increased serum Abeta1-42 and reductions in brain amyloid in ApoE4 noncarriers (not in carriers). There were significant elevations in serum triglycerides in bexarotene-treated patients. There was no consistent change in any clinical measure. Conclusions: The primary outcome of this trial was negative. The data suggest that bexarotene reduced brain amyloid and increased serum Abeta1-42 in ApoE4 noncarriers. Elevated triglycerides could represent a cardiovascular risk, and bexarotene should not be administered outside a research setting. RXR agonists warrant further investigations as AD therapies.

abstract = {In clinical trials, an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) is often established to perform both ongoing safety data monitoring and interim efficacy analysis. These evaluations are performed in a blinded fashion in order to avoid possible operational biases that may be introduced to the trial after the review of the data. The DMCs for clinical trials using adaptive design methods are also positioned to implement the adaptation decision according to the prospective adaptation algorithm. While the DMC plays an important role in maintaining the validity and integrity of the intended clinical trial, adaptive design clinical trials trigger a greater role and increased responsibility for the DMC. To assist the sponsor in establishing a DMC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a draft guidance entitled Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees in 2006. In this article, the composition, role/responsibility, and function/activity of a DMC are described. Concerns of the additional responsibilities of the DMC for adaptive design clinical trials are addressed. Although the intention of the DMC is well-intentioned, controversial issues inevitably occur. These controversial issues include, but are not limited to, (1) the challenge of the independence of a DMC and (2) the issue regarding the direct communication between the DMC and the FDA.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has focused on finding biomarkers to identify disease at the pre-clinical stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), allowing treatment to be initiated before irreversible damage occurs. Many studies have examined brain imaging or cerebrospinal fluid but there is also growing interest in blood biomarkers. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has generated data on 190 plasma analytes in 566 individuals with MCI, AD or normal cognition. We conducted independent analyses of this dataset to identify plasma protein signatures predicting pre-clinical AD.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We focused on identifying signatures that discriminate cognitively normal controls (n = 54) from individuals with MCI who subsequently progress to AD (n = 163). Based on p value, apolipoprotein E (APOE) showed the strongest difference between these groups (p = 2.3 × 10(-13)). We applied a multivariate approach based on combinatorial optimization (($\alpha$,$\beta$)-k Feature Set Selection), which retains information about individual participants and maintains the context of interrelationships between different analytes, to identify the optimal set of analytes (signature) to discriminate these two groups. We identified 11-analyte signatures achieving values of sensitivity and specificity between 65{\%} and 86{\%} for both MCI and AD groups, depending on whether APOE was included and other factors. Classification accuracy was improved by considering "meta-features," representing the difference in relative abundance of two analytes, with an 8-meta-feature signature consistently achieving sensitivity and specificity both over 85{\%}. Generating signatures based on longitudinal rather than cross-sectional data further improved classification accuracy, returning sensitivities and specificities of approximately 90{\%}.

CONCLUSIONS: Applying these novel analysis approaches to the powerful and well-characterized ADNI dataset has identified sets of plasma biomarkers for pre-clinical AD. While studies of independent test sets are required to validate the signatures, these analyses provide a starting point for developing a cost-effective and minimally invasive test capable of diagnosing AD in its pre-clinical stages.},

@article{Ito2010a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various authors have evaluated disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), using patient data from individual clinical studies or pooled data across various trials. We conducted a systematic review of public data sources from 1990 to 2008 for all available AChE inhibitor studies, as well as clinical studies that evaluated the rate of deterioration in AD patients. Unique to this analysis, we developed a model based on literature data to describe the longitudinal response in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog) (change from baseline) in mild to moderate severity AD patients. The model was used to estimate disease progression for both placebo-treated patients and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibitor treated patients, and factors that affected disease progression.

METHODS: We collected 576 mean ADAS-cog changes from baseline data points of 52 trials, representing data from approximately 19,972 patients and more than 84,000 individual observations. The model described the rate of disease progression, the evident placebo effect, and the symptomatic effect of AChE-inhibitors. Baseline ADAS-cog, Mini-Mental State Examination score, age, and year of publication were tested as covariates.

RESULTS: The disease progression in mild to moderate AD patients across all available and relevant literature sources was estimated as 5.5 points per year. An Emax-type model best described the symptomatic drug effect of AChE inhibitors. The rate of disease progression (underlying disease progression) was no different between placebo and AChE-inhibitors groups. Baseline ADAS-cog is a significant covariate in disease progression. Baseline age was also tested as a covariate in the rate of disease progression, but the model was unable to describe any effects of age, likely because of the narrow distribution of mean age (literature-level analysis). There was no significant impact of publication year in the model.

CONCLUSIONS: Baseline ADAS-cog is a significant covariate affecting the rate of disease progression, and it describes or at least explains the different rates of deterioration evident in early or late stages of the disease. There was no significant impact of publication year in the model, suggesting that disease progression has not slowed in more recent trials.},

@article{Tractenberg2007a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the performance of a test of temporal orientation (TTO) comprising four items derived from the Mini-Mental State Examination over 4 years.

METHODS: Responses were obtained from two large cohorts participating in longitudinal studies of aging in the United States (352 normal elderly, 98 persons with very mild probable or possible Alzheimer's disease). Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value (positive, PV+, negative, PV-) of the TTO were estimated for each of four annual visits.

RESULTS: When four correct answers were treated as "oriented to time" and 0 to 3 correct answers were treated as "not oriented to time," sensitivity (to the presence of AD) ranged from 46.0{\%} to 69.2{\%} and PV+ ranged from 32.1{\%} to 49.5{\%}. Specificity (for normal cognition) decreased from 93.2{\%} at the first visit to 81.3{\%} at the fourth visit; TTO performed most reliably in terms of PV-, the probability of normal cognitive function given orientation to time (TTO = 4), which ranged from 92.8{\%} to 95.4{\%}.

CONCLUSION: Given the stability and strength of the predictive negative value of a dichotomized TTO over time, a TTO could contribute to monitoring normal cognitive functioning in longitudinal studies in which cognitive status is not the primary focus. Prospective validation of the TTO is warranted.},

abstract = {We outline the general framework of adaptive combination tests and discuss their relationship to flexible group sequential designs. An important field of applications is sample size reassessment. We discuss reassessment rules based on conditional power arguments using either the observed or the prefixed effect size. These rules tend to lead to large expected sample sizes for small actual effects. However, the application of a maximal bound for the second stage sample size leads to more favourable properties. Additionally, we consider an optimized reassessment rule in terms of expected sample sizes. Since the adaptive design does not use the classical test statistics for some types of sample size reassessments, the adaptive test may reject the null hypothesis while the classical one-sample test does not. We characterize sample size reassessment rules, where such inconsistencies are avoided. Finally, the extension of flexibility to the number of stages is explored. In the first interim analysis a second interim analysis is only planned if the chance to achieve a decision there is high. This leads to savings in the average number of interim analysis performed, without paying a noticeable price in terms of expected sample size.},

abstract = {Motivated by potentially serious imbalances of continuous baseline covariates in clinical trials, we investigated the cost in statistical power of ignoring the balance of these covariates in treatment allocation design for a logistic regression model. Based on data from a clinical trial of acute ischemic stroke treatment, computer simulations were used to create scenarios varying from the best possible baseline covariate balance to the worst possible imbalance, with multiple balance levels between the two extremes. The likelihood of each scenario occurring under simple randomization was evaluated. The power of the main effect test for treatment was examined. Our simulation results show that the worst possible imbalance is highly unlikely, but it can still occur under simple random allocation. Also, power loss could be nontrivial if balancing distributions of important continuous covariates were ignored even if adjustment is made in the analysis for important covariates. This situation, although unlikely, is more serious for trials with a small sample size and for covariates with large influence on primary outcome. These results suggest that attempts should be made to balance known prognostic continuous covariates at the design phase of a clinical trial even when adjustment is planned for these covariates at the analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In repeated measures studies, equidistant time-points do not always yield efficient treatment effect estimators. In the present paper, the optimal allocation of time-points is calculated for a small number of repeated measures, different covariance structures and linearly divergent treatment effects. The gain in efficiency of the treatment effect estimator by using optimally allocated time-points instead of equidistant time-points or by adding optimally spaced measures (at the expense of patients) is then computed. The assumed covariance structure is crucial for the results. For a compound symmetric covariance structure, a large gain in efficiency is obtained by adding repeated measures at the end of the study. For a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure, highly efficient treatment effect estimators are obtained with only two repeated measures, i.e. at the start and at the end of the study. For a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure including measurement error, the gain in efficiency by adding optimally spaced measures depends on the covariance parameter values. The gain in efficiency is similar with or without a random intercept. For a fixed study budget, the commonly used design with more than two equally spaced measures was never optimal for the linear cost function and covariance structures that were used. If the covariance structure is unknown, the optimal design based on a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure with measurement error is preferable in terms of robustness against misspecification of the covariance structure. The numerical results are illustrated by two examples.},

abstract = {Comparing two proportions through the difference is a basic problem in statistics and has applications in many fields. More than twenty confidence intervals (Newcombe, 1998a,b) have been proposed. Most of them are approximate intervals with an asymptotic infimum coverage probability much less than the nominal level. In addition, large sample may be costly in practice. So exact optimal confidence intervals become critical for drawing valid statistical inference with accuracy and precision. Recently, Wang (2010, 2012) derived the exact smallest (optimal) one-sided 1 − $\alpha$ confidence intervals for the difference of two paired or independent proportions. His intervals, however, are computer-intensive by nature. In this article, we provide an R package ExactCIdiff to implement the intervals when the sample size is not large. This would be the first available package in R to calculate the exact confidence intervals for the difference of proportions. Exact two-sided 1 − $\alpha$ interval can be easily obtained by taking the intersection of the lower and upper one-sided 1 − $\alpha$/2 intervals. Readers may jump to Examples 1 and 2 to obtain these intervals.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to describe the longitudinal cognitive outcome in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and analyze factors that affect the outcome, including the impact of different cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI).

METHODS: In an open, three-year, nonrandomized, prospective, multicenter study, 843 patients were treated with donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine in a routine clinical setting. At baseline and every six months, patients were assessed using several rating scales, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the dose of ChEI was recorded. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were investigated. The relationships of these predictors with longitudinal cognitive ability were analyzed using mixed-effects models.

RESULTS: Slower long-term cognitive decline was associated with a higher cognitive ability at baseline or a lower level of education. The improvement in cognitive response after six months of ChEI therapy and a more positive longitudinal outcome were related to a higher mean dose of ChEI, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)/acetylsalicylic acid usage, male gender, older age, and absence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4 allele. More severe cognitive impairment at baseline also predicted an improved response to ChEI treatment after six months. The type of ChEI agent did not influence the short-term response or the long-term outcome.

CONCLUSIONS: In this three-year AD study performed in a routine clinical practice, the response to ChEI treatment and longitudinal cognitive outcome were better in males, older individuals, non-carriers of the APOE $\epsilon$4 allele, patients treated with NSAIDs/acetylsalicylic acid, and those receiving a higher dose of ChEI, regardless of the drug agent.},

METHOD Twenty-one healthy participants with MCI were recruited in our double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. They were assigned to either an AS group, who received ingestible capsules containing AS, or a placebo group, who received identical placebo capsules. To assess cognitive functions, we performed the Japanese version of the Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNSVS) test and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cog test at baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks of dietary supplementation. RESULTS The CNSVS test revealed significant improvements in psychomotor speed and processing speed in the AS group compared with the placebo group, suggesting that the daily supplementation of AS improved cognitive functions related to the ability to comprehend, and perform complex tasks quickly and accurately. CONCLUSION Our results provide support for the use of AS as a dietary supplementation for improving cognitive functions.},

abstract = {Simon's two-stage design is commonly used in phase II single-arm clinical trials because of its simplicity and smaller sample size under the null hypothesis compared to the one-stage design. Some studies extend this design to accommodate more interim analyses (i.e., three-stage or four-stage designs). However, most of these studies, together with the original Simon's two-stage design, are based on the exhaustive search method, which is difficult to extend to high-dimensional, general multi-stage designs. In this study, we propose a simulated annealing (SA)-based design to optimize the early stopping boundaries and minimize the expected sample size for multi-stage or continuous monitoring single-arm trials. We compare the results of the SA method, the decision-theoretic method, the predictive probability method, and the posterior probability method. The SA method can reach the smallest expected sample sizes in all scenarios under the constraints of the same type I and type II errors. The expected sample sizes from the SA method are generally 10-20{\%} smaller than those from the posterior probability method or the predictive probability method, and are slightly smaller than those from the decision-theoretic method in almost all scenarios. The SA method offers an excellent alternative in designing phase II trials with continuous monitoring.},

abstract = {The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) was formed to direct the design and management of interventional therapeutic trials of international DIAN and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) participants. The goal of the DIAN-TU is to implement safe trials that have the highest likelihood of success while advancing scientific understanding of these diseases and clinical effects of proposed therapies. The DIAN-TU has launched a trial design that leverages the existing infrastructure of the ongoing DIAN observational study, takes advantage of a variety of drug targets, incorporates the latest results of biomarker and cognitive data collected during the observational study, and implements biomarkers measuring Alzheimer's disease (AD) biological processes to improve the efficiency of trial design. The DIAN-TU trial design is unique due to the sophisticated design of multiple drugs, multiple pharmaceutical partners, academics servings as sponsor, geographic distribution of a rare population and intensive safety and biomarker assessments. The implementation of the operational aspects such as home health research delivery, safety magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) at remote locations, monitoring clinical and cognitive measures, and regulatory management involving multiple pharmaceutical sponsors of the complex DIAN-TU trial are described. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (APOE) dependent lifetime risks (LTRs) for Alzheimer Disease (AD) are currently not accurately known and odds ratios alone are insufficient to assess these risks. We calculated AD LTR in 7351 cases and 10 132 controls from Caucasian ancestry using Rochester (USA) incidence data. At the age of 85 the LTR of AD without reference to APOE genotype was 11{\%} in males and 14{\%} in females. At the same age, this risk ranged from 51{\%} for APOE44 male carriers to 60{\%} for APOE44 female carriers, and from 23{\%} for APOE34 male carriers to 30{\%} for APOE34 female carriers, consistent with semi-dominant inheritance of a moderately penetrant gene. Using PAQUID (France) incidence data, estimates were globally similar except that at age 85 the LTRs reached 68 and 35{\%} for APOE 44 and APOE 34 female carriers, respectively. These risks are more similar to those of major genes in Mendelian diseases, such as BRCA1 in breast cancer, than those of low-risk common alleles identified by recent GWAS in complex diseases. In addition, stratification of our data by age groups clearly demonstrates that APOE4 is a risk factor not only for late-onset but for early-onset AD as well. Together, these results urge a reappraisal of the impact of APOE in Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {In the dependency rule mining, the goal is to discover the most significant statistical dependencies among all possible collapsed 2×2 contingency tables. Fisher's exact test is a robust method to estimate the significance and it enables efficient pruning of the search space. The problem is that evaluating the required p-value can be very laborious and the worst case time complexity is O(n), where n is the data size. The traditional solution is to approximate the significance with the $\chi$2-measure, which can be estimated in a constant time. However, the $\chi$2-measure can produce unreliable results (discover spurious dependencies but miss the most significant dependencies). Furthermore, it does not support efficient pruning of the search space. As a solution, a family of tight upper bounds for Fisher's p is introduced. The new upper bounds are fast to calculate and approximate Fisher's p-value accurately. In addition, the new approximations are not sensitive to the data size, distribution, or smallest expected counts like the $\chi$2-based approximation. In practice, the execution time depends on the desired accuracy level. According to experimental evaluation, the simplest upper bounds are already sufficiently accurate for dependency rule mining purposes and they can be estimated in 0.004-0.1{\%} of the time needed for exact calculation. For other purposes (testing very weak dependencies), one may need more accurate approximations, but even they can be calculated in less than 1{\%} of the exact calculation time.},

abstract = {An ideal measure of global functioning for patients with dementia would discriminate at very high and very low levels of functioning and would have linear measurement properties such that a given change in score corresponds to the same amount of change in underlying ability at any part of the ability continuum. Using item response theory methods, linearity of test measurement can be directly assessed and items can be selected to construct a test with desired measurement characteristics. The purpose of this study was to apply item response theory methods to evaluating and developing global functioning scales. Subjects were 1207 patients who had received comprehensive dementia evaluations. Items were selected from two measures of cognitive functioning (Mini Mental State Examination, MMS; Blessed Information Memory Concentration Test, BIMCT) and one measure of independent functioning (Blessed-Roth Dementia Rating Scale, BRDRS). The MMS and BIMCT showed significant non-linearity of measurement, especially at low and high ability levels. A brief composite measure was created by selecting from the three instruments 25 items that fit a uniform distribution of item difficulty across the entire range of ability measured by the three instruments. This composite measure and the BRDRS showed better linearity of measurement than the other two instruments. Results have implications for development of a psychometrically sophisticated, brief measure of global functioning for clinical and research use in dementia.},

abstract = {Motivated by a study on comparing sensitivities and specificities of two diagnostic tests in a paired design when the sample size is small, we first derived an Edgeworth expansion for the studentized difference between two binomial proportions of paired data. The Edgeworth expansion can help us understand why the usual Wald interval for the difference has poor coverage performance in the small sample size. Based on the Edgeworth expansion, we then derived a transformation based confidence interval for the difference. The new interval removes the skewness in the Edgeworth expansion; the new interval is easy to compute, and its coverage probability converges to the nominal level at a rate of O(n-1/2). Numerical results indicate that the new interval has the average coverage probability that is very close to the nominal level on average even for sample sizes as small as 10. Numerical results also indicate this new interval has better average coverage accuracy than the best existing intervals in finite sample sizes. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We introduce a statistical, process-oriented metadata model to describe the process of medical research data collection, management, results analysis and dissemination. Our approach explicitly provides a structure for pieces of information used in Clinical Study Data Management Systems, enabling a more active role for any associated metadata. Using the object-oriented paradigm, we describe the classes of our model that participate during the design of a clinical trial and the subsequent collection and management of the relevant data. The advantage of our approach is that we focus on presenting the structural inter-relation of these classes when used during datasets manipulation by proposing certain transformations that model the simultaneous processing of both data and metadata. Our solution reduces the possibility of human errors and allows for the tracking of all changes made during datasets lifecycle. The explicit modeling of processing steps improves data quality and assists in the problem of handling data collected in different clinical trials. The case study illustrates the applicability of the proposed framework demonstrating conceptually the simultaneous handling of datasets collected during two randomized clinical studies. Finally, we provide the main considerations for implementing the proposed framework into a modern Metadata-enabled Information System.},

abstract = {Randomized clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) typically assess intervention efficacy with measures of cognitive or functional assessments repeated every six months for one to two years. The Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (MMRM), which assumes an "unstructured mean" by treating time as categorical, is attractive because it makes no assumptions about the shape of the mean trajectory of the outcome over time. However, categorical time models may be over-parameterized and inefficient in detecting treatment effects relative to continuous time models of, say, the linear trend of the outcome over time. Mixed effects models can also be extended to model quadratic time effects, although it is questionable whether the duration and interval of observations in AD and MCI studies is sufficient to support such models. Furthermore, it is unknown which of these models are most robust to missing data, which plagues AD and MCI studies. We review the literature and compare estimates of treatment effects from four potential models fit to data from five AD Cooperative Study (ADCS) trials in MCI and AD.},

The most notable of these immunotherapies are bapineuzumab and solanezumab.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAREAS COVERED: This article briefly reviews the experimental agents in development for treatment of AD and then discusses the results of bapineuzumab and solanezumab in AD patients, as reported in preclinical studies, clinical trials and press releases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERT OPINION: Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Solanezumab's two Phase III trials in AD patients failed to meet endpoints when analyzed independently. However, analysis of pooled data from both trials showed a significant reduction in cognitive decline in mild AD patients. The improvement was associated with an increase in plasma amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) levels and a low incidence of ARIA in solanezumab-treated patients. The marginal benefits of solanezumab are encouraging to support continued evaluation in future studies, and offer small support in favor of the ongoing viability of the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' of AD.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pooled data from three double-blind, randomized studies with 12-week, placebo-controlled (acute) and 52-week, routine-care-controlled (extension) phases.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency/discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

RESULTS: There were 1139 (placebo, n = 339; duloxetine, n = 800) and 867 (routine-care, n = 287; duloxetine, n = 580) patients in the acute and extension phases, respectively. Patient details were as follow: 60 years (mean age); Caucasian, 84{\%}; and male, 57{\%}. In the acute phase, there were significantly more TEAEs, duloxetine versus placebo (p = 0.001), the most common being nausea and somnolence. Discontinuations due to adverse events were significantly greater (12.5 vs 5.6{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), with similar outcomes in the extension phase. Baseline-to-endpoint aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase were significantly increased and fasting plasma glucose was increased for duloxetine (0.67 mmol/l) versus decreased in routine-care (-0.64 mmol/l, p {\textless} 0.001). HbA1c was significantly increased, duloxetine vs routine-care, in the extension phase (52 vs 19{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). Endpoint measures neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy indicated no disease progression.

CONCLUSIONS: Duloxetine was generally safe and well tolerated, with the three most commonly reported TEAEs being nausea, somnolence and constipation. Modest changes in glycemia were associated with duloxetine. Aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase increases were transient and not considered predictive of more severe outcomes.},

abstract = {Minimization is a largely nonrandom method of treatment allocation for clinical trials. We conducted a systematic literature search to determine its advantages and disadvantages compared with other allocation methods. Minimization was originally proposed by Taves and by Pocock and Simon. The latter paper introduces a family of allocation methods of which Taves' method is the simplest example. Minimization aims to ensure treatment arms are balanced with respect to predefined patient factors as well as for the number of patients in each group. Further extensions of the method have also been proposed by other authors. Simulation studies show that minimization provides better balanced treatment groups when compared with restricted or unrestricted randomization and that it can incorporate more prognostic factors than stratified randomization methods such as permuted blocks within strata. Some more computationally complex methods may give an even better performance. Concerns over the use of minimization have centered on the fact that treatment assignments may be predicted with certainty in some situations and on the implications for the analysis methods used. It has been suggested that adjustment should always be made for minimization factors when analyzing trials where minimization is the allocation method used. The use of minimization may sometimes result in added organizational complexity compared with other methods. Minimization has been recommended by many commentators for use in clinical trials. Despite this it is still rarely used in practice. From the evidence presented in this review, we believe minimization to be a highly effective allocation method and recommend its wider adoption in the conduct of randomized controlled trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The order and magnitude of pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease are not well understood, partly because the disease develops over many years. Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease has a predictable age at onset and provides an opportunity to determine the sequence and magnitude of pathologic changes that culminate in symptomatic disease. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study, we analyzed data from 128 participants who underwent baseline clinical and cognitive assessments, brain imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood tests. We used the participant's age at baseline assessment and the parent's age at the onset of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to calculate the estimated years from expected symptom onset (age of the participant minus parent's age at symptom onset). We conducted cross-sectional analyses of baseline data in relation to estimated years from expected symptom onset in order to determine the relative order and magnitude of pathophysiological changes. RESULTS: Concentrations of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$)(42) in the CSF appeared to decline 25 years before expected symptom onset. A$\beta$ deposition, as measured by positron-emission tomography with the use of Pittsburgh compound B, was detected 15 years before expected symptom onset. Increased concentrations of tau protein in the CSF and an increase in brain atrophy were detected 15 years before expected symptom onset. Cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory were observed 10 years before expected symptom onset. Global cognitive impairment, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, was detected 5 years before expected symptom onset, and patients met diagnostic criteria for dementia at an average of 3 years after expected symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: We found that autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease was associated with a series of pathophysiological changes over decades in CSF biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease, brain amyloid deposition, and brain metabolism as well as progressive cognitive impairment. Our results require confirmation with the use of longitudinal data and may not apply to patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

Methods Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-1/GO data, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were calculated to quantify the sensitivity of a measure for detecting disease progression and hypothetical treatment effects. All possible combinations of selected sensitive measures were assessed for developing composite scores. The analyses were performed in the MCI population and subpopulations enriched by apolipoprotein E4 (APOE $\epsilon$4), hippocampal volume, and cerebrospinal fluid $\beta$-amyloid. Results The best composite score was "Word Recall + Delayed Word Recall + Orientation + CDR-SB + FAQ", more sensitive than 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale or CDR-SB. Conclusion The proposed composite score derived from the existing clinical endpoints demonstrated higher sensitivity in the MCI population and is easy to implement and standardize across studies.},

Methods We characterized the temporal trajectories of measures of verbal episodic memory, short-term visual memory, and mental status using data from 895 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Results The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) immediate recall was the first measure to decline, followed by CVLT delayed recall. However, further along the disease progression scale, CVLT delayed recall and visual memory changed more rapidly than CVLT immediate recall. Conclusions Our findings reconcile reports of early changes in immediate recall with greater reliance on delayed recall performance in clinical settings. Moreover, the utility of cognitive markers in evaluating AD progression depends on the stage of cognitive decline, suggesting that optimal endpoints in therapeutic trials may vary across different stages of the disease process.},

@article{Thall1999,
abstract = {Phase I dose-finding trials typically are conducted using adaptive rules that select dose levels for successive patient cohorts based on the outcomes of patients treated previously in the trial. When patient outcome cannot be observed immediately after treatment, the problem arises of how to deal with new patients while waiting to observe the current patient cohort's outcomes. We consider two alternative approaches to this problem in the context of a phase I trial conducted using the continual reassessment method. With the first approach, a patient requiring treatment before the next cohort opens is treated off protocol with standard therapy, and otherwise waits until the next cohort opens. The second approach treats each patient immediately upon arrival at the dose recommended based on currently available data. We compare these two approaches by simulation under varying dose--toxicity curves, accrual rates, cohort sizes and early stopping rules. We evaluate patient waiting time, trial duration, number of patients treated off protocol and the probabilities of toxicity and of selecting the correct dose. We also study three strategies for assigning patients to trials when two or more phase I trials may be ongoing simultaneously. Based on our results, we provide practical guidelines for deciding among these approaches and strategies in a given clinical setting.},

@article{Lancaster1949,
abstract = {(1) It is shown how the general term of any multinomial can be reduced to a series of binomial terms, to each of which corresponds a value of $\chi$2 for one degree or freedom. In an accompanying paper (pp. 130-4 below), Dr J. O. Irwin (1949) has shown that corresponding to this reduction there is an exact partition of $\chi$2 and a certain Helmert matrix. This partition can be formally related to regression analysis by showing that it is equivalent to the selection of variables of the form {\$}x{\_}{\{}i\backslashldot jk\backslashldots{\}}/\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}i\backslashldot jk\backslashldots{\}}{\$}. (2) The expression for the probability of an r × s contingency table can be partitioned into the product of the probability of (r - 1)(s - 1) fourfold tables, the $\chi$ of each of which is uncorrelated with that of any of the others. Asymptotically, when the expected frequencies are large, all the $\chi$'s are normally distributed so that we have (r - 1)(s - 1) normal and uncorrelated deviates. Any difficulties as to degrees of freedom are avoided in this proof. (3) It is further shown that corresponding to the method of treating the r × s table set out in (2), there is an exact partition of $\chi$2 which can be obtained by pre- and post-multiplication of the (r × s) matrix of standardized variables by certain Helmert matrices. This operation makes the variables in the first row and in the first column all zero, leaving a matrix with (r - 1)(s - 1) standardized and uncorrelated variables. Each of these variables is the $\chi$ of one of the component fourfold tables, when calculated by the use of expectations obtained from the original margins and not from the component table itself. (4) Numerical examples are given for the case of a multinomial distribution, for the four-fold table and for a 3 × 3 table. In each case the partition of $\chi$2 is illustrated.},

abstract = {Previous studies of A$\beta$ plasma as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) obtained conflicting results. We here included 715 subjects with baseline A$\beta$(1-40) and A$\beta$(1-42) plasma measurement (50{\%} with 4 serial annual measurements): 205 cognitively normal controls (CN), 348 patients mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 162 with AD. We assessed the factors that modified their concentrations and correlated these values with PIB PET, MRI and tau and A$\beta$(1-42) measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Association between A$\beta$ and diagnosis (baseline and prospective) was assessed. A number of health conditions were associated with altered concentrations of plasma A$\beta$. The effect of age differed according to AD stage. Plasma A$\beta$(1-42) showed mild correlation with other biomarkers of A$\beta$ pathology and were associated with infarctions in MRI. Longitudinal measurements of A$\beta$(1-40) and A$\beta$(1-42) plasma levels showed modest value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression. Our longitudinal study of complementary measures of A$\beta$ pathology (PIB, CSF and plasma A$\beta$) and other biomarkers in a cohort with an extensive neuropsychological battery is significant because it shows that plasma A$\beta$ measurements have limited value for disease classification and modest value as prognostic factors over the 3-year follow-up. However, with longer follow-up, within subject plasma A$\beta$ measurements could be used as a simple and minimally invasive screen to identify those at increased risk for AD. Our study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the biology and dynamics of plasma A$\beta$ as well as the need for longer term studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma A$\beta$.},

abstract = {The problem of testing for a centre effect in multi-centre studies following a proportional hazards regression analysis is considered. Two approaches to the problem can be used. One fits a proportional hazards model with a fixed covariate included for each centre (except one). The need for a centre specific adjustment is evaluated using either a score, Wald or likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that all the centre specific effects are equal to zero. An alternative approach is to introduce a random effect or frailty for each centre into the model. Recently, Commenges and Andersen have proposed a score test for this random effects model. By a Monte Carlo study we compare the performance of these two approaches when either the fixed or random effects model holds true. The study shows that for moderate samples the fixed effects tests have nominal levels much higher than specified, but the random effect test performs as expected under the null hypothesis. Under the alternative hypothesis the random effect test has good power to detect relatively small fixed or random centre effects. Also, if the centre effect is ignored the estimator of the main treatment effect may be quite biased and is inconsistent. The tests are illustrated on a retrospective multi-centre study of recovery from bone marrow transplantation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To study how composite outcomes, which have combined several components into a single measure, are defined, reported, and interpreted. DESIGN Systematic review of parallel group randomised clinical trials published in 2008 reporting a binary composite outcome. Two independent observers extracted the data using a standardised data sheet, and two other observers, blinded to the results, selected the most important component. RESULTS Of 40 included trials, 29 (73{\%}) were about cardiovascular topics and 24 (60{\%}) were entirely or partly industry funded. Composite outcomes had a median of three components (range 2-9). Death or cardiovascular death was the most important component in 33 trials (83{\%}). Only one trial provided a good rationale for the choice of components. We judged that the components were not of similar importance in 28 trials (70{\%}); in 20 of these, death was combined with hospital admission. Other major problems were change in the definition of the composite outcome between the abstract, methods, and results sections (13 trials); missing, ambiguous, or uninterpretable data (9 trials); and post hoc construction of composite outcomes (4 trials). Only 24 trials (60{\%}) provided reliable estimates for both the composite and its components, and only six trials (15{\%}) had components of similar, or possibly similar, clinical importance and provided reliable estimates. In 11 of 16 trials with a statistically significant composite, the abstract conclusion falsely implied that the effect applied also to the most important component. CONCLUSIONS The use of composite outcomes in trials is problematic. Components are often unreasonably combined, inconsistently defined, and inadequately reported. These problems will leave many readers confused, often with an exaggerated perception of how well interventions work.},

abstract = {In controlled clinical trials, where minimizing treatment failures is crucial, response-adaptive designs are attractive competitors to 1:1 randomized designs for comparing the success rates $\phi$(1) and $\phi$(2) of two treatments. In these designs each new treatment assignment depends on previous outcomes through some predefined rule. Here Play-The-Winner (PW), Randomized Play-The-Winner (RPW), Drop-The-Loser, Generalized Drop-the-Loser and Doubly adaptive Biased Coin Designs are considered for new treatment assignments. As frequentist inference relies on complex sampling distributions in those designs, we investigate how Bayesian inference, based on two independent Beta prior distributions, performs from a frequentist point-of-view. Performance is assessed through coverage probabilities of interval estimation procedures, power and minimization of failure count. It is shown that Bayesian inference can be favorably compared to frequentist procedures where the latter are available. The power of response-adaptive designs is generally very close to the power of 1:1 randomized design. However, failure count savings are generally small, except for the PW and Doubly adaptive Biased Coin designs in particular ranges of the true success rates. The RPW assignment rule has the worst performance, while PW, Generalized Drop-the-Loser or Doubly adaptive Biased Coin Designs may outperform other designs depending on different particular ranges of the true success rates.},

abstract = {Diagnostic processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are evolving. Knowledge about disease-specific biomarkers is constantly increasing and larger volumes of data are being measured from patients. To gain additional benefits from the collected data, a novel statistical modeling and data visualization system is proposed for supporting clinical diagnosis of AD. The proposed system computes an evidence-based estimate of a patient's AD state by comparing his or her heterogeneous neuropsychological, clinical, and biomarker data to previously diagnosed cases. The AD state in this context denotes a patient's degree of similarity to previously diagnosed disease population. A summary of patient data and results of the computation are displayed in a succinct Disease State Fingerprint (DSF) visualization. The visualization clearly discloses how patient data contributes to the AD state, facilitating rapid interpretation of the information. To model the AD state from complex and heterogeneous patient data, a statistical Disease State Index (DSI) method underlying the DSF has been developed. Using baseline data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the ability of the DSI to model disease progression from elderly healthy controls to AD and its ability to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD were assessed. It was found that the DSI provides well-behaving AD state estimates, corresponding well with the actual diagnoses. For predicting conversion from MCI to AD, the DSI attains performance similar to state-of-the-art reference classifiers. The results suggest that the DSF establishes an effective decision support and data visualization framework for improving AD diagnostics, allowing clinicians to rapidly analyze large quantities of diverse patient data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To examine whether it is appropriate to sum the cognitive part of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) items to assess cognitive impairment. This assumes items to have (1) equal measurement precision and (2) hierarchically ordered categories.

METHODS: Rasch analysis on the basis of pooled data from 3 Randomized Controlled Trials was used to examine these assumptions and to estimate each patient's level of impairment. Analyses were replicated in an independent sample.

RESULTS: The original ADAS-cog scoring did not fit the Rasch Model and did not reliably distinguish between impairment levels. Patients with equal test scores had different impairment levels. Similarly, patients with different test scores could have the same impairment level. Revising the ADAS-cog by (1) weighting the items by their measurement precision and (2) collapsing nonhierarchical item categories resulted in good fit and a valid one to one correspondence between sum scores and estimated impairment levels. This revealed that equal differences in ADAS-cog scores did not reflect equal differences in impairment level along the test's score range.

CONCLUSIONS: It is appropriate to summate the ADAS-cog items provided that the items are weighted and have their categories hierarchically ordered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta(1-42) concentration and high total-tau/Abeta(1-42) ratio have been recommended to support the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and also to select patients for clinical trials (Shaw et al, Ann Neurol 2009;65:403-13; Dubois et al, Lancet Neurol 2007;6:734-46).

METHODS: We tested this recommendation with clinical trials simulations using patients from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who fulfilled the following entry criteria: (1) aMCI, (2) aMCI with CSF Abeta(1-42) {\textless}or=192 mg/mL, (3) and aMCI with total-tau/Abeta(1-42) {\textgreater}0.39. For each criterion, we randomly resampled the database obtaining samples for 1000 trials for each trial scenario, planning for 1 or 2 year trials with samples from 50 to 400 patients per treatment or placebo group, with up to 40{\%} dropouts, outcomes after using the AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale and clinical dementia rating scale with effect sizes ranging from 0.15 to 0.75, and calculated statistical power.

FINDINGS: Approximately 70{\%} to 74{\%} of aMCI patients with CSF measures met biomarker criteria. The addition of the low Abeta(1-42) or high tau/Abeta(1-42) requirement resulted in minimal or no increase in the power of the trials compared with enrolling aMCI without requiring the biomarker criteria. Slightly larger mean differences between the placebo and treatment groups fulfilling biomarker criteria were offset by increased outcome variability within the groups.

INTERPRETATIONS: Although patients with aMCI or patients with prodromal AD meeting CSF biomarkers criteria were slightly more cognitively impaired and showed greater decline than patients with aMCI diagnosed without considering the biomarkers, the requirement of biomarker-positive patients would most likely not result in more efficient clinical trials, and trials would take longer because fewer patients would be available. A CSF Abeta(1-42) marker, however, could be useful as an explanatory variable or covariate when warranted by the action of a drug.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Whereas cognitive deficits are known to be detectable long before the typical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are evident, previous studies have failed to determine when cognitive functioning actually begins to decline before dementia. Utilizing the long follow-up of the PAQUID study, we examined the emergence of the first clinical symptoms over a 14-year period of follow-up before the dementia phase of AD.

METHODS: This study relies on a case-control sample selected from the PAQUID cohort. Of the 3,777 initial subjects of the cohort, 350 subjects experienced development of AD during the 14 years of follow-up. The cases were matched to 350 elderly control subjects. The evolution of scores on cognitive, functional, and depression scales was described throughout the 14-year follow-up using a semiparametric extension of the mixed-effects linear model.

RESULTS: The first decline in cognitive performances appeared as early as 12 years before dementia in measures of semantic memory and conceptual formation. Then, more global deficits appeared that were concomitant with an increase in memory complaints and depressive symptoms. About 2 years later, as a consequence of cognitive dysfunction, the subjects started to become slightly dependent in their activities of daily living. In the last 3 years, the impairment significantly worsened until the subjects reached the dementia phase.

INTERPRETATION: This approach, describing the 14 years preceding dementia, provides a clear illustration of the particularly long and progressive prodromal phase of AD, and shows the successive emergence of cognitive deficits, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment during this phase.},

abstract = {Pretest-posttest designs serve as building blocks for other more complicated repeated-measures designs. In settings where subjects are independent and errors follow a bivariate normal distribution, data analysis may consist of a univariate repeated-measures analysis or an analysis of covariance. Another possible analysis approach is to use seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The purpose of this article is to help guide the statistician toward an appropriate analysis choice. Assumptions, estimates, and test statistics for each analysis are approached in a systematic manner. On the basis of these results, the crucial choice of analysis is whether differences in pretest group means are conceived to be real or the result of pure measurement error. Direct consultation of the statistician with a subject-matter person is important in making the right choice. If pretest group differences are real, then a univariate repeated-measures analysis is recommended. If pretest group differences are the result of pure measurement error, then a conditional analysis or SUR analysis should be used. The conditional analysis and the SUR analysis will produce similar results. Smaller variance estimates can be expected based on the SUR analysis, but this gain is partially mediated by a lack of an exact distribution for test statistics. {\textcopyright} 1988 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Recent contributions to the statistical literature have provided elegant model-based solutions to the problem of estimating sample sizes for testing the significance of differences in mean rates of change across repeated measures in controlled longitudinal studies with differentially correlated error and missing data due to dropouts. However, the mathematical complexity and model specificity of these solutions make them generally inaccessible to most applied researchers who actually design and undertake treatment evaluation research in psychiatry. In contrast, this article relies on a simple two-stage analysis in which dropout-weighted slope coefficients fitted to the available repeated measurements for each subject separately serve as the dependent variable for a familiar ANCOVA test of significance for differences in mean rates of change. This article is about how a sample of size that is estimated or calculated to provide desired power for testing that hypothesis without considering dropouts can be adjusted appropriately to take dropouts into account. Empirical results support the conclusion that, whatever reasonable level of power would be provided by a given sample size in the absence of dropouts, essentially the same power can be realized in the presence of dropouts simply by adding to the original dropout-free sample size the number of subjects who would be expected to drop from a sample of that original size under conditions of the proposed study.},

abstract = {Alpha spending function and stochastic curtailment are two frequently used methods in group sequential design. In the stochastic curtailment approach, the actual type I error probability cannot be well controlled within the specified significance level. But conditional power (CP) in stochastic curtailment is easier to be accepted and understood by clinicians. In this paper, we develop a spending function based on the concept of conditional power, named CP function, which combines desirable features of alpha spending and stochastic curtailment. Like other two-parameter functions, CP function is flexible to fit the needs of the trial. A simulation study is conducted to explore the choice of CP boundary in CP function that maximizes the trial power. It is equivalent to, even better than, classical Pocock, O'Brien-Fleming, and quadratic spending function as long as a proper $\rho$0 is given, which is pre-specified CP threshold for efficacy. It also well controls the overall type I error type I error rate and overcomes the disadvantage of stochastic curtailment. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: There is currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials. Objectives: To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI). Data sources: We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches. Review methods: The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes. Results: We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally. Limitations: Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network. Conclusions: Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.Copyright {\textcopyright} Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2017.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) PET is a marker of cortical fibrillar amyloid-beta load in vivo. We used (11)C-PiB PET to investigate whether bapineuzumab, a humanised anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody, would reduce cortical fibrillar amyloid-beta load in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

METHODS: Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease were randomly assigned to receive intravenous bapineuzumab or placebo in a ratio of seven to three in three ascending dose groups (0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg). Each dose group was enrolled after safety review of the previous group. Randomisation was by interactive voice response system; masking was achieved with numbered kit allocation. Patients, investigators, study site personnel, sponsor staff, and carers were masked to treatment. Patients received up to six infusions, 13 weeks apart, and had (11)C-PiB PET scans at baseline and at weeks 20, 45, and 78. The primary outcome was the difference between the pooled bapineuzumab group and the pooled placebo group in mean change from screening to week 78 in (11)C-PiB cortical to cerebellar retention ratio averaged across six cortical regions of interest. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2004-004120-12; ISRCTN17517446.

FINDINGS: 28 patients were assigned to bapineuzumab (n=20) or placebo (n=8). 19 patients in the bapineuzumab group and seven in the placebo group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated mean (11)C-PiB retention ratio change from baseline to week 78 was -0.09 (95{\%} CI -0.16 to -0.02; p=0.014) in the bapineuzumab group and 0.15 (95{\%} CI 0.02 to 0.28; p=0.022) in the placebo group. Estimated mean difference in (11)C-PiB retention ratio change from baseline to week 78 between the bapineuzumab group and the placebo group was -0.24 (95{\%} CI -0.39 to -0.09; p=0.003). Differences between the bapineuzumab group and the placebo group in the individual regions of interest were similar to the overall mean difference. Adverse events were typically mild to moderate in severity and transient. Two patients in the 2.0 mg/kg bapineuzumab group had transient cerebral vasogenic oedema.

INTERPRETATION: Treatment with bapineuzumab for 78 weeks reduced cortical (11)C-PiB retention compared with both baseline and placebo. (11)C-PiB PET seems to be useful in assessing the effects of potential Alzheimer's disease treatments on cortical fibrillar amyloid-beta load in vivo.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Florbetapir F 18 (F-AV-45) is a positron emission tomography imaging ligand for the detection of amyloid aggregation associated with Alzheimer disease. Earlier data showed that florbetapir F 18 binds with high affinity to $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) plaques in human brain homogenates (Kd=3.7 nM) and has favorable imaging pharmacokinetic properties, including rapid brain penetration and washout. This study used human autopsy brain tissue to evaluate the correlation between in vitro florbetapir F 18 binding and A$\beta$ density measured by established neuropathologic methods. METHODS The localization and density of florbetapir F 18 binding in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of postmortem brain tissue from 40 patients with a varying degree of neurodegenerative pathology was assessed by standard florbetapir F 18 autoradiography and correlated with the localization and density of A$\beta$ identified by silver staining, thioflavin S staining, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS There were strong quantitative correlations between florbetapir F 18 tissue binding and both A$\beta$ plaques identified by light microscopy (Silver staining and thioflavin S fluorescence) and by immunohistochemical measurements of A$\beta$ using 3 antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the A$\beta$ peptide. Florbetapir F 18 did not bind to neurofibrillary tangles. CONCLUSIONS Florbetapir F 18 selectively binds A$\beta$ in human brain tissue. The binding intensity was quantitatively correlated with the density of A$\beta$ plaques identified by standard neuropathologic techniques and correlated with the density of A$\beta$ measured by immunohistochemistry. As A$\beta$ plaques are a defining neuropathologic feature for Alzheimer disease, these results support the use of florbetapir F 18 as an amyloid positron emission tomography ligand to identify the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology in patients with signs and symptoms of progressive late-life cognitive impairment.},

abstract = {We sought to develop and evaluate a composite memory score from the neuropsychological battery used in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used modern psychometric approaches to analyze longitudinal Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT, 2 versions), AD Assessment Schedule - Cognition (ADAS-Cog, 3 versions), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Logical Memory data to develop ADNI-Mem, a composite memory score. We compared RAVLT and ADAS-Cog versions, and compared ADNI-Mem to RAVLT recall sum scores, four ADAS-Cog-derived scores, the MMSE, and the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. We evaluated rates of decline in normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, ability to predict conversion from MCI to AD, strength of association with selected imaging parameters, and ability to differentiate rates of decline between participants with and without AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signatures. The second version of the RAVLT was harder than the first. The ADAS-Cog versions were of similar difficulty. ADNI-Mem was slightly better at detecting change than total RAVLT recall scores. It was as good as or better than all of the other scores at predicting conversion from MCI to AD. It was associated with all our selected imaging parameters for people with MCI and AD. Participants with MCI with an AD CSF signature had somewhat more rapid decline than did those without. This paper illustrates appropriate methods for addressing the different versions of word lists, and demonstrates the additional power to be gleaned with a psychometrically sound composite memory score.},

The authors report the results of a phase IIa immunotherapy trial of AN1792(QS-21) in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) that was interrupted because of meningoencephalitis in 6{\%} of immunized patients. METHODS: This randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of IM AN1792 225 microg plus the adjuvant QS-21 50 microg (300 patients) and saline (72 patients) included patients aged 50 to 85 years with probable AD, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 15 to 26. Injections were planned for months 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Safety and tolerability were evaluated, and pilot efficacy (AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale [ADAS-Cog], MRI, neuropsychological test battery [NTB], CSF tau, and Abeta42) was assessed in anti-AN1792 antibody responder patients (immunoglobulin G titer {\textgreater} or = 1:2,200). RESULTS: Following reports of meningoencephalitis (overall 18/300 [6{\%}]), immunization was stopped after one (2 patients), two (274 patients), or three (24 patients) injections. Of the 300 AN1792(QS-21)-treated patients, 59 (19.7{\%}) developed the predetermined antibody response. Double-blind assessments were maintained for 12 months. No significant differences were found between antibody responder and placebo groups for ADAS-Cog, Disability Assessment for Dementia, Clinical Dementia Rating, MMSE, or Clinical Global Impression of Change, but analyses of the z-score composite across the NTB revealed differences favoring antibody responders (0.03 +/- 0.37 vs -0.20 +/- 0.45; p = 0.020). In the small subset of subjects who had CSF examinations, CSF tau was decreased in antibody responders (n = 11) vs placebo subjects (n = 10; p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although interrupted, this trial provides an indication that Abeta immunotherapy may be useful in Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been proposed as a potential agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD) immunotherapy because it contains antibodies against beta-amyloid (Abeta). We carried out an open label dose-ranging study in 8 mild AD patients in which IVIg was added to approved AD therapies for 6 months, discontinued, and then resumed for another 9 months. Infusions were generally well-tolerated. Anti-Abeta antibodies in the serum from AD patients increased in proportion to IVIg dose and had a shorter half-life than anti-hepatitis antibodies and total IgG. Plasma Abeta levels increased transiently after each infusion. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta decreased significantly at 6 months, returned to baseline after washout and decreased again after IVIg was re-administered for an additional 9 months. Mini-mental state scores increased an average of 2.5 points after 6 months, returned to baseline during washout and remained stable during subsequent IVIg treatment.

@article{Rees2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Rees et al. Background: Early identification of participants at risk of run-in failure (RIF) may present opportunities to improve trial efficiency and generalizability. Methods: We conducted a partial factorial-design, randomized, controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D to prevent colorectal adenoma recurrence at 11 centers in the United States. At baseline, participants completed two self-administered questionnaires (SAQs) and a questionnaire administered by staff. Participants in the full factorial randomization (calcium, vitamin D, both, or neither) received a placebo during a 3-month single-blinded run-in; women electing to take calcium enrolled in a two-group randomization (calcium with vitamin D, or calcium alone) and received calcium during the run-in. Using logistic regression models, we examined baseline factors associated with RIF in three subgroups: men (N = 1606) and women (N = 301) in the full factorial randomization and women in the two-group randomization (N = 666). Results: Overall, 314/2573 (12 {\%}) participants failed run-in; 211 (67 {\%}) took fewer than 80 {\%} of their tablets (poor adherence), and 103 (33 {\%}) withdrew or were uncooperative. In multivariable models, 8- to 13-fold variation was seen by study center in odds of RIF risk in the two largest groups. In men, RIF decreased with age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 5 years 0.85 [95 {\%} confidence interval, CI; 0.76-0.96]) and was associated with being single (OR 1.65 [95 {\%} CI; 1.10-2.47]), not graduating from high school (OR 2.77 [95 {\%} CI; 1.58-4.85]), and missing SAQ data (OR 1.97 [1.40-2.76]). Among women, RIF was associated primarily with health-related factors; RIF risk was lower with higher physical health score (OR 0.73 [95 {\%} CI; 0.62-0.86]) and baseline multivitamin use (OR 0.44 [95 {\%} CI; 0.26-0.75]). Women in the 5-year colonoscopy surveillance interval were at greater risk of RIF than those with 3-year follow-up (OR 1.91 [95 {\%} CI; 1.08-3.37]), and the number of prescription medicines taken was also positively correlated with RIF (p = 0.03). Perceived toxicities during run-in were associated with 12- to 29-fold significantly increased odds of RIF. Conclusions: There were few common baseline predictors of run-in failure in the three randomization groups. However, heterogeneity in run-in failure associated with study center, and missing SAQ data reflect potential opportunities for intervention to improve trial efficiency and retention.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper was to illustrate the influence of missing data on the results of longitudinal statistical analyses [i.e., MANOVA for repeated measurements and Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE)] and to illustrate the influence of using different imputation methods to replace missing data. Besides a complete dataset, four incomplete datasets were considered: two datasets with 10{\%} missing data and two datasets with 25{\%} missing data. In both situations missingness was considered independent and dependent on observed data. Imputation methods were divided into cross-sectional methods (i.e., mean of series, hot deck, and cross-sectional regression) and longitudinal methods (i.e., last value carried forward, longitudinal interpolation, and longitudinal regression). Besides these, also the multiple imputation method was applied and discussed. The analyses were performed on a particular (observational) longitudinal dataset, with particular missing data patterns and imputation methods. The results of this illustration shows that when MANOVA for repeated measurements is used, imputation methods are highly recommendable (because MANOVA as implemented in the software used, uses listwise deletion of cases with a missing value). Applying GEE analysis, imputation methods were not necessary. When imputation methods were used, longitudinal imputation methods were often preferable ab9ove cross-sectional imputation methods, in a way that the point estimates and standard errors were closer to the estimates derived from the complete dataset. Furthermore, this study showed that the theoretically more valid multiple imputation method did not lead to different point estimates than the more simple (longitudinal) imputation methods. However, the estimated standard errors appeared to be theoretically more adequate, because they reflect the uncertainty in estimation caused by missing values.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: For inferring a treatment effect from the difference between a treated and untreated group on a quantitative outcome measured before and after treatment, current methods are analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the outcome with the baseline as covariate, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of change from baseline. This article compares both methods on power and bias, for randomized and nonrandomized studies. Methods: The methods are compared by writing both as a regression model and as a repeated measures model, and are applied to a nonrandomized study of preventing depression. Results: In randomized studies both methods are unbiased, but ANCOVA has more power. If treatment assignment is based on the baseline, only ANCOVA is unbiased. In nonrandomized studies with preexisting groups differing at baseline, the two methods cannot both be unbiased, and may contradict each other. In the study of depression, ANCOVA suggests absence, but ANOVA of change suggests presence, of a treatment effect. The methods differ because ANCOVA assumes absence of a baseline difference. Conclusion: In randomized studies and studies with treatment assignment depending on the baseline, ANCOVA must be used. In nonrandomized studies of preexisting groups, ANOVA of change seems less biased than ANCOVA, but two control groups and two baseline measurements are recommended. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Modern machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used in neuroimaging studies, such as the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural MRI. However, finding a good representation for multivariate brain MRI features in which their essential structure is revealed and easily extractable has been difficult. We report a successful application of a machine learning framework that significantly improved the use of brain MRI for predictions. Specifically, we used the unsupervised learning algorithm of local linear embedding (LLE) to transform multivariate MRI data of regional brain volume and cortical thickness to a locally linear space with fewer dimensions, while also utilizing the global nonlinear data structure. The embedded brain features were then used to train a classifier for predicting future conversion to AD based on a baseline MRI. We tested the approach on 413 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had baseline MRI scans and complete clinical follow-ups over 3 years with the following diagnoses: cognitive normal (CN; n=137), stable mild cognitive impairment (s-MCI; n=93), MCI converters to AD (c-MCI, n=97), and AD (n=86). We found that classifications using embedded MRI features generally outperformed (p{\textless}0.05) classifications using the original features directly. Moreover, the improvement from LLE was not limited to a particular classifier but worked equally well for regularized logistic regressions, support vector machines, and linear discriminant analysis. Most strikingly, using LLE significantly improved (p=0.007) predictions of MCI subjects who converted to AD and those who remained stable (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: =0.68/0.80/0.56). In contrast, predictions using the original features performed not better than by chance (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: =0.56/0.65/0.46). In conclusion, LLE is a very effective tool for classification studies of AD using multivariate MRI data. The improvement in predicting conversion to AD in MCI could have important implications for health management and for powering therapeutic trials by targeting non-demented subjects who later convert to AD.},

abstract = {In many longitudinal studies, evaluating the effect of a binary or continuous predictor variable on the rate of change of the outcome, i.e. slope, is often of primary interest. Sample size determination of these studies, however, is complicated by the expectation that missing data will occur due to missed visits, early drop out, and staggered entry. Despite the availability of methods for assessing power in longitudinal studies with missing data, the impact on power of the magnitude and distribution of missing data in the study population remain poorly understood. As a result, simple but erroneous alterations of the sample size formulae for complete/balanced data are commonly applied. These ‘naive' approaches include the average sum of squares and average number of subjects methods. The goal of this article is to explore in greater detail the effect of missing data on study power and compare the performance of naive sample size methods to a correct maximum likelihood-based method using both mathematical and simulation-based approaches. Two different longitudinal aging studies are used to illustrate the methods.},

abstract = {In recent years, the use of the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach in imputing missing data in clinical trials has been greatly criticized, and several likelihood-based modeling approaches are proposed to analyze such incomplete data. One of the proposed likelihood-based methods is the Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model. To compare the performance of LOCF and MMRM approaches in analyzing incomplete data, two extensive simulation studies are conducted, and the empirical bias and Type I error rates associated with estimators and tests of treatment effects under three missing data paradigms are evaluated. The simulation studies demonstrate that LOCF analysis can lead to substantial biases in estimators of treatment effects and can greatly inflate Type I error rates of the statistical tests, whereas MMRM analysis on the available data leads to estimators with comparatively small bias, and controls Type I error rates at a nominal level in the presence of missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR) and some possibility of missing not at random (MNAR) data. In a sensitivity analysis of 48 clinical trial datasets obtained from 25 New Drug Applications (NDA) submissions of neurological and psychiatric drug products, MMRM analysis appears to be a superior approach in controlling Type I error rates and minimizing biases, as compared to LOCF ANCOVA analysis. In the exploratory analyses of the datasets, no clear evidence of the presence of MNAR missingness is found.},

We created a relatively comprehensive web-based data system that provided electronic data entry; patient management utilities; adverse event reporting, safety monitoring, and invoice generation; and standardized coding for medications and adverse events. In stage 1, clinical sites submitted 7207 forms reporting on 105 patients followed for 10 months. Less than 0.7{\%} of submitted forms contained errors. At the time of the delivery of the analysis data set, only four errors remained unresolved. Data were available quickly, with a median time from event to data posting of two days. The data set was locked and the analysis data set produced nine days after the final patient visit. A survey of trial personnel yielded generally positive feedback, with 75{\%} of respondents wishing to use a similar system in the future. Given sufficient resources, a comprehensive web-based data management system can meet the need for clean, available data in clinical trials in ALS and similar diseases, and can contribute significantly to their efficient execution.},

abstract = {A Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based classification technique is employed for a quantitative global assessment of brain tissue changes by using pixel intensities and contrast generated by b-values in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). A hemisphere approach is also proposed. A GMM identifies the variability in the main brain tissues at a macroscopic scale rather than searching for tumours or affected areas. The asymmetries of the mixture distributions between the hemispheres could be used as a sensitive, faster tool for early diagnosis. The k-means algorithm optimizes the parameters of the mixture distributions and ensures that the global maxima of the likelihood functions are determined. This method has been illustrated using 18 sub-classes of DTI data grouped into six levels of diffusion weighting (b = 0; 250; 500; 750; 1000 and 1250 s/mm 2 ) and three main brain tissues. These tissues belong to three subjects, i.e., healthy, multiple haemorrhage areas in the left temporal lobe and ischaemic stroke. The mixing probabilities or weights at the class level are estimated based on the sub-class-level mixing probability estimation. Furthermore, weighted Euclidean distance and multiple correlation analysis are applied to analyse the dissimilarity of mixing probabilities between hemispheres and subjects. The silhouette data evaluate the objective quality of the clustering. By using a GMM in the present study, we establish an important variability in the mixing probability associated with white matter and grey matter between the left and right hemispheres.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Agitation is one of the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is associated with serious adverse consequences for patients and caregivers. Evidence-supported treatment options for agitation are limited. The citalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (CitAD) study was designed to evaluate the potential of citalopram to ameliorate these symptoms.

METHODS: CitAD is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial, with two parallel treatment groups assigned in a 1:1 ratio and randomization stratified by clinical center. The study included eight recruiting clinical centers, a chair's office, and a coordinating center located in university settings in the United States and Canada. A total of 200 individuals having probable AD with clinically significant agitation and without major depression were recruited for this study. Patients were randomized to receive citalopram (target dose of 30 mg/d) or matching placebo. Caregivers of patients in both treatment groups received a structured psychosocial therapy. Agitation was compared between treatment groups using the NeuroBehavioral Rating Scale and the AD Cooperative Study- Clinical Global Impression of Change, which are the primary outcomes. Functional performance, cognition, caregiver distress, and rates of adverse and serious adverse events were also measured.

CONCLUSION: The authors believe the design elements in CitAD are important features to be included in trials assessing the safety and efficacy of psychotropic medications for clinically significant agitation in AD.},

The three alternative methods were based on important members of the generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) family, specifically on the empirical likelihood (EL) method, the exponential tilting (ET) method, and the continuous updated estimator (CUE) method. Two criteria were considered for the comparison of the four statistical methods: the root mean squared error and the empirical coverage of the nominal 95{\%} confidence intervals for the difference between means.

In addition to assessing drugs for symptomatic relief, an increasing number of trials are focusing on potential disease-modifying agents. Moreover, participants with AD are being studied earlier in their course of disease. As a result, the limitations of current outcome measures have become more apparent, as has the need for better instruments. In recognition of the need to review and possibly revise current assessment measures, the Alzheimer's Association, in cooperation with industry leaders and academic investigators, convened a Research Roundtable meeting devoted to scales as outcome measures for AD clinical trials. The meeting included a discussion of methodological issues in the use of scales in AD clinical trials, including cross-cultural issues. Specific topics related to the use of cognitive, functional, global, and neuropsychiatric scales were also presented. Speakers also addressed academic and industry initiatives for pooling data from untreated and placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. A number of regulatory topics were also discussed with agency representatives. Panel discussions highlighted areas of controversy, in an effort to gain consensus on various topics.},

METHOD: Subjective and objective assessments of memory performance were compared in relation to the presence or absence of the APOE-4 allele in 39 cognitively intact persons with mild memory complaints. RESULTS: Subjects with the APOE-4 allele had lower scores on objective verbal memory and on the subjective memory measure for retrospective functioning. Among the subjects in the age range where APOE-4 has its greatest influence on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (55-74 years), the APOE-4 group had lower scores on the subjective memory measure for frequency of forgetting. Moreover, the standardized difference in retrospective functioning scores between the two genetic risk groups increased when the mid-age-range group was examined rather than the whole study group. CONCLUSIONS: The APOE-4 allele is associated with increased subjective memory impairment in middle-aged and older adults. Longitudinal studies of age-related memory loss should include genetic risk and subjective memory measures as potential predictors of decline.},

abstract = {Background: The primary analysis in a longitudinal randomized controlled trial is sometimes a comparison of arms at a single time point. While a two-sample t-test is often used, missing data are common in longitudinal studies and decreases power by reducing sample size. Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) can test treatment effects at specific time points, have been shown to give unbiased estimates in certain missing data contexts, and may be more powerful than a two sample t-test. Methods: We conducted a simulation study to compare the performance of a complete-case t-test to a MMRM in terms of power and bias under different missing data mechanisms. Impact of within- and between-person variance, dropout mechanism, and variance-covariance structure were all considered. Results: While both complete-case t-test and MMRM provided unbiased estimation of treatment differences when data were missing completely at random, MMRM yielded an absolute power gain of up to 12 {\%}. The MMRM provided up to 25 {\%} absolute increased power over the t-test when data were missing at random, as well as unbiased estimation.

This paper describes methods for projecting the incidence and prevalence of a chronic disease in ageing populations. The approach uses age-specific disease incidence rates together with assumptions about survival to reconstruct disease prevalence. The methods can be used to evaluate the potential impact of public health interventions that may prevent disease or prolong survival. We used the methods to project the future prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States. We found that the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease will nearly quadruple over the next 50 years. Although projections of the absolute prevalence are sensitive to assumptions about the age-specific incidence rates of disease, the proportionate growth is relatively insensitive. The increase in prevalence results from the ageing of the U.S. population. In order to perform the calculations, we have assembled U.S. Census population projections and U.S. mortality rates into computer software that is available from the authors at www.jhsph.edu/Departments/Biostats/software.h tml.},

abstract = {The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research eagerly awaits the results of a large number of Phase III clinical trials that are underway to investigate the effectiveness of anti-amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) immunotherapy for AD. In this case report, we review the pertinent clinical history, examine the neuropathology, and characterize the A$\beta$ profile of an AD patient who received bapineuzumab immunotherapy. The patient received four bapineuzumab infusions over a 39 week period. During the course of this treatment, there was no remarkable change in cognitive impairment as determined by MMSE scores. Forty-eight days after the fourth bapineuzumab infusion was given, MRI revealed that the patient had developed lacunar infarcts and possible vasogenic edema, probably related to immunotherapy, but a subsequent MRI scan 38 days later demonstrated resolution of vasogenic edema. The patient expired due to acute congestive heart failure complicated by progressive AD and cerebrovascular accident 378 days after the first bapineuzumab infusion and 107 days after the end of therapy. Neuropathological and biochemical analysis did not produce evidence of lasting plaque regression or clearance of A$\beta$ due to immunotherapy. The A$\beta$ species profile of this case was compared with non-immunized AD cases and non-demented controls and found to be similar to non-immunized AD cases. SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of full-length A$\beta$₁₋₄₂ and truncated A$\beta$ peptides demonstrating species with and without bapineuzumab specific epitopes. These results suggest that, in this particular case, bapineuzumab immunotherapy neither resulted in detectable clearance of amyloid plaques nor prevented further cognitive impairment.},

abstract = {Identifying correlation structure is important to achieving estimation efficiency in analyzing longitudinal data, and is also crucial for drawing valid statistical inference for large size clustered data. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric method to estimate the correlation structure, which is applicable for discrete longitudinal data. We utilize eigenvector-based basis matrices to approximate the inverse of the empirical correlation matrix and determine the number of basis matrices via model selection. A penalized objective function based on the difference between the empirical and model approximation of the correlation matrices is adopted to select an informative structure for the correlation matrix. The eigenvector representation of the correlation estimation is capable of reducing the risk of model misspecification, and also provides useful information on the specific within-cluster correlation pattern of the data. We show that the proposed method possesses the oracle property and selects the true correlation structure consistently. The proposed method is illustrated through simulations and two data examples on air pollution and sonar signal studies.},

Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often represents a prodromal form of dementia, conferring a 10-15{\%} annual risk of converting to probable AD. We analyzed baseline 1.5T MRI scans in 693 participants from the ADNI cohort divided into four groups by baseline diagnosis and one year MCI to probable AD conversion status to identify neuroimaging phenotypes associated with MCI and AD and potential predictive markers of imminent conversion. MP-RAGE scans were analyzed using publicly available voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automated parcellation methods. Measures included global and hippocampal grey matter (GM) density, hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, and cortical thickness values from entorhinal cortex and other temporal and parietal lobe regions. The overall pattern of structural MRI changes in MCI (n=339) and AD (n=148) compared to healthy controls (HC, n=206) was similar to prior findings in smaller samples. MCI-Converters (n=62) demonstrated a very similar pattern of atrophic changes to the AD group up to a year before meeting clinical criteria for AD. Finally, a comparison of effect sizes for contrasts between the MCI-Converters and MCI-Stable (n=277) groups on MRI metrics indicated that degree of neurodegeneration of medial temporal structures was the best antecedent MRI marker of imminent conversion, with decreased hippocampal volume (left {\textgreater} right) being the most robust. Validation of imaging biomarkers is important as they can help enrich clinical trials of disease modifying agents by identifying individuals at highest risk for progression to AD.},

However, the mechanism whereby exercise exerts these beneficial effects is unclear. There has been increasing interest in the use of whole genome peripheral blood gene expression in a wide range of conditions to attempt to identify both novel mechanisms of disease and transcriptional biomarkers. This protocol describes a study in which we will assess the effect of a structured exercise programme on peripheral blood gene expression in patients with stable angina, and correlate this with changes in angina level, anxiety, depression, and exercise capacity. METHODS: Sixty patients with stable angina will be recruited and randomised 1:1 to exercise training or conventional care. Patients randomised to exercise training will attend an exercise physiology laboratory up to three times weekly for supervised aerobic interval training sessions of one hour in total duration. Patients will undergo assessments of angina, anxiety, depression, and peripheral blood gene expression at baseline, after six and twelve weeks of training, and twelve weeks after formal exercise training ceases. DISCUSSION: This study will provide comprehensive data on the effect of exercise training on peripheral blood gene expression in patients with angina. By correlating this with improvement in angina status we will identify candidate peripheral blood transcriptional markers predictive of improvements in angina level in response to exercise training.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To assess the hypothesis that in a sample of very healthy elderly men selected to minimize risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease, myelin breakdown in late-myelinating regions mediates age-related slowing in cognitive processing speed (CPS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prefrontal lobe white matter and the genu of the corpus callosum myelinate later in brain development (late-myelinating white matter; LMWM) and are more vulnerable to breakdown due to the effects of normal aging. An in vivo MRI biomarker of myelin integrity (transverse relaxation rates; R(2)) of LMWM was obtained for 38 very healthy elderly adult men (mean age=66.3 years; SD=6.0; range=55-76). To evaluate regional specificity, we also assessed a contrasting early-myelinating region (splenium of the corpus callosum; SWM), which primarily contains axons involved in visual processing. CPS was assessed using the Trail Making Test.

RESULTS: LMWM R(2) and CPS measures were significantly correlated (r=.515, p=.0009), but no significant association between R(2) and CPS was detected in the splenium (p=.409). LMWM R(2), but not SWM R(2), was a significant mediator of the relationship between age and CPS (p=.037).

CONCLUSIONS: In this very healthy elderly sample, age-related slowing in CPS is mediated by myelin breakdown in highly vulnerable late-myelinating regions but not in the splenium.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To develop preventive therapy for Alzheimer disease (AD), it is essential to develop AD-related biomarkers that identify at-risk individuals in the same way that cholesterol levels identify persons at risk for heart disease.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma levels of amyloid beta protein (Abeta40 and Abeta42) are useful for identifying cognitively normal elderly white subjects at increased risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.

DESIGN: Using well-established sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were analyzed at baseline in a prospective, elderly white cohort followed up for 2 to 12 (median, 3.7) years to detect incident cases of MCI or AD.

SETTING: Cognitively normal, community-based white volunteers recruited from primary care settings into the Mayo Rochester Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry. Patients We followed up 563 cognitively normal white volunteers (median age, 78 years; 62{\%} female) who had at least 1 follow-up visit after measurement of baseline plasma Abeta levels.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to development of MCI or AD. The secondary outcome was the annualized rate of cognitive change in patients for whom we had 2 Mattis Dementia Rating Scale evaluations 3 to 7 years apart.

RESULTS: During follow-up, 53 subjects developed MCI or AD. Subjects with plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios in the lower quartiles showed significantly greater risk of MCI or AD (P = .04, adjusted for age and apolipoprotein E genotype). Comparison of subjects with plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios in the lowest vs the highest quartile gave a relative risk of 3.1 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.1-8.3). After adjusting for age and apolipoprotein E genotype, regression analysis using annualized changes in the Dementia Rating Scale scores as an outcome variable showed that participants with lower Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios had greater cognitive decline (P = .02).

CONCLUSION: The plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio may be a useful premorbid biomarker for identifying cognitively normal elderly white subjects who are at increased risk for developing MCI or AD.},

These variable selection procedures are applied in the context of case-crossover studies. We study the performances of conventional and sparse modelling strategies by simulations, then empirically compare results of these methods on the analysis of the association between exposure to medicinal drugs and the risk of causing an injurious road traffic crash in elderly drivers. Controlling the false discovery rate of lasso-type methods is still problematic, but this problem is also present in conventional methods. The sparse methods have the ability to provide a global analysis of dependencies, and we conclude that some of the variants compared here are valuable tools in the context of case-crossover studies with a large number of variables.},

abstract = {Randomized, prospective trials involving multi-institutional collaboration have become a central part of clinical and translational research. However, data management and coordination of multi-center studies is a complex process that involves developing systems for data collection and quality control, tracking data queries and resolutions, as well as developing communication procedures. We describe DADOS-Prospective, an open-source Web-based application for collecting and managing prospective data on human subjects for clinical and translational trials. DADOS-Prospective not only permits users to create new clinical research forms (CRF) and supports electronic signatures, but also offers the advantage of containing, in a single environment, raw research data in downloadable spreadsheet format, source documentation and regulatory files stored in PDF format, and audit trails. Feedback from formal and field usability tests was used to guide the design and development of DADOS-Prospective. To date, DADOS-Prospective has been implemented in five prospective clinical studies at our institution. Four of these studies are still in the CRF creation phase and one study has been entirely launched. DADOS-Prospective has significant advantages over existing Web-based data collecting programs. At our institution, it has been demonstrated to be an efficient tool for prospective clinical studies.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging centers and pharmaceutical companies are working together to evaluate treatments that might slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common but devastating late-life neuropathology. Recently, automated brain mapping methods, such as tensor-based morphometry (TBM) of structural MRI, have outperformed cognitive measures in their precision and power to track disease progression, greatly reducing sample size estimates for drug trials. In the largest TBM study to date, we studied how sample size estimates for tracking structural brain changes depend on the time interval between the scans (6-24 months). We analyzed 1309 brain scans from 91 probable AD patients (age at baseline: 75.4+/-7.5 years) and 189 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 74.6+/-7.1 years), scanned at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Statistical maps revealed 3D patterns of brain atrophy at each follow-up scan relative to the baseline; numerical summaries were used to quantify temporal lobe atrophy within a statistically-defined region-of-interest. Power analyses revealed superior sample size estimates over traditional clinical measures. Only 80, 46, and 39 AD patients were required for a hypothetical clinical trial, at 6, 12, and 24 months respectively, to detect a 25{\%} reduction in average change using a two-sided test (alpha=0.05, power=80{\%}). Correspondingly, 106, 79, and 67 subjects were needed for an equivalent MCI trial aiming for earlier intervention. A 24-month trial provides most power, except when patient attrition exceeds 15-16{\%}/year, in which case a 12-month trial is optimal. These statistics may facilitate clinical trial design using voxel-based brain mapping methods such as TBM.},

abstract = {In oncology, a patient's treatment often involves multiple courses of chemotherapy. The most common medical practice in choosing treatments for successive courses is to repeat a treatment that is successful in a given course and otherwise switch to a different treatment. Patient outcome thus consists of a sequence of dependent response variables and corresponding treatments. Despite the widespread use of such adaptive 'play-the-winner-and-drop-the-loser' algorithms in medical settings involving multiple treatment courses, most statistical methods for treatment evaluation characterize early patient outcome as a single response to a single treatment, resulting in a substantial loss of information. In this paper, we provide a statistical framework for multi-course clinical trials involving some variant of the play-the-winner-and-drop-the-loser strategy. The aim is to design and conduct the trial to more closely reflect actual clinical practice, and thus increase the amount of information per patient. The proposed design is similar to a multi-stage cross-over trial, with the essential difference that here all treatments after the first course are assigned adaptively. We illustrate the method by application to a randomized phase II trial for androgen independent prostate cancer. We consider the goals of selecting one best treatment, or selecting a best ordered pair of treatments with the second given if the first fails to achieve a patient success. A simulation study is reported, and extensions to trials involving toxicity or regimen-related death are discussed.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence supports a role for innate immunity and microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. However, no marker related to microglia has been included in the temporal evolution models of AD. TREM2 is a transmembrane protein involved in innate immunity and is selectively expressed by microglia and genetically linked to AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Its ectodomain is released by proteolysis as a soluble variant (sTREM2) and can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In patients with autosomal dominant AD, we tested how many years before the expected symptom onset did CSF sTREM2 increase in mutation carriers (MCs) compared to noncarriers (NCs). We also determined the temporal sequence of changes in CSF sTREM2 and markers for amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration as well as cognitive performance. We included 218 participants consisting of 127 MC and 91 NC siblings from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. We observed that CSF sTREM2 increased in MCs compared to NCs 5 years before the expected symptom onset and this difference remained significant until 5 years after the expected symptom onset. Changes in CSF sTREM2 occurred after alterations were observed in markers for brain amyloidosis and neuronal injury. We propose that microglial activation occurs several years before the expected symptom onset, but after amyloidosis and neuronal injury have already occurred.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Besides cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to physical disability, need for help and permanent institutional care. The trials investigating effects of exercise rehabilitation on physical functioning of home-dwelling older dementia patients are still scarce. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of intensive exercise rehabilitation lasting for one year on mobility and physical functioning of home-dwelling patients with AD.

METHODS: During years 2008-2010, patients with AD (n = 210) living with their spousal caregiver in community are recruited using central AD registers in Finland, and they are offered exercise rehabilitation lasting for one year. The patients are randomized into three arms: 1) tailored home-based exercise twice weekly 2) group-based exercise twice weekly in rehabilitation center 3) control group with usual care and information of exercise and nutrition. Main outcome measures will be Guralnik's mobility and balance tests and FIM-test to assess physical functioning. Secondary measures will be cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms according to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, caregivers' burden, depression and health-related quality of life (RAND-36). Data concerning admissions to institutional care and the use and costs of health and social services will be collected during a two year follow-up.

DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this is the first large scale trial exploring whether home-dwelling patients with AD will benefit from intense and long-lasting exercise rehabilitation in respect to their mobility and physical functioning. It will also provide data on cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

abstract = {Abstract. Cortical $\beta$-amyloid deposition begins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) years before the onset of any clinical symptoms. It is therefore important to determine the temporal trajectories of amyloid deposition in these earliest stages in order to better understand their associations with progression to AD. A method for estimating the temporal trajectories of voxelwise amyloid as measured using longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is presented. The method involves the estimation of a score for each subject visit based on the PET data that reflects their amyloid progression. This amyloid progression score allows subjects with similar progressions to be aligned and analyzed together. The estimation of the progression scores and the amyloid trajectory parameters are performed using an expectation-maximization algorithm. The correlations among the voxel measures of amyloid are modeled to reflect the spatial nature of PET images. Simulation results show that model parameters are captured well at a variety of noise and spatial correlation levels. The method is applied to longitudinal amyloid imaging data considering each cerebral hemisphere separately. The results are consistent across the hemispheres and agree with a global index of brain amyloid known as mean cortical DVR. Unlike mean cortical DVR, which depends on a priori defined regions, the progression score extracted by the method is data-driven and does not make assumptions about regional longitudinal changes. Compared to regressing on age at each voxel, the longitudinal trajectory slopes estimated using the proposed method show better localized longitudinal changes.},

@article{Cannon1997a,
abstract = {Although mortality is the most important endpoint in evaluating new regimens, insistence on its use as the only endpoint in clinical trials can require that thousands of patients be studied. Accordingly, composite endpoints have been increasingly used to increase the overall event rate and thereby reduce the number of patients needed for the trial. For use as part of composite endpoint, nonfatal endpoints should be clinically meaningful, i.e., related to an adverse subsequent prognosis. In acute myocardial infarction (MI), several intermediate endpoints in the well-described pathophysiology of acute MI have been correlated with an adverse long-term outcome: recurrent MI, new onset congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction, large infarct size, and failure to achieve early patency of the infarct-related artery. Furthermore, in acute MI, new therapies that improve these nonfatal endpoints also improve mortality, thereby validating this approach. Once this link is established, such nonfatal endpoints can be validly used in evaluating new therapies. Note, however, if this link has not been made (that mortality is reduced when there is a reduction in the nonfatal endpoint), as in the case of suppression of ventricular premature complexes with antiarrhythmic therapy, the nonfatal endpoint cannot be used validly. Thus, appropriately designed and validated composite endpoints can provide a valid means of testing new treatments in a smaller trial than one using mortality alone. Their use should allow testing of a greater number of new regimens, thereby allowing more rapid progress toward improving the clinical outcome of patients.},

abstract = {Many have suggested a bootstrap procedure for estimating the sampling variability of principal component analysis (PCA) results. However, when the number of measurements per subject (p) is much larger than the number of subjects (n), calculating and storing the leading principal compo- nents from each bootstrap sample can be computationally infeasible. To address this, we outline methods for fast, exact calculation of bootstrap principal components, eigenvalues, and scores. Our methods leverage the fact that all bootstrap samples occupy the same n-dimensional subspace as the original sample. As a result, all bootstrap principal components are limited to the same n-dimensional subspace and can be efficiently represented by their low dimensional coordinates in that subspace. Several uncertainty metrics can be computed solely based on the bootstrap dis- tribution of these low dimensional coordinates, without calculating or storing the p-dimensional bootstrap components. Fast bootstrap PCA is applied to a dataset of sleep electroencephalogram recordings (p = 900, n = 392), and to a dataset of brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) (p ≈ 3 million, n = 352). For the MRI dataset, our method allows for standard errors for the first 3 prin- cipal components based on 1000 bootstrap samples to be calculated on a standard laptop in 47 minutes, as opposed to approximately 4 days with standard methods.},

abstract = {The comparisons of treatments in randomized clinical trials may use the analysis of covariance to adjust for patient characteristics. We present theoretical results that describe when such an adjustment would be expected to be beneficial. A distinction is made between covariates that are balanced in the design and those that are assigned by the randomization process. The results support the commonly held view that features balanced in the design of the trial (e.g., by stratification) and those that are strongly predictive of the outcome, and thus considered clinically prognostic, should normally be included in the analysis. For other covariates that are not balanced in the design, the potential benefits of including them in the analysis will depend on the number of patients in the trial. However, there is frequently a set of variables whose relevance is unknown and for which data-dependent methods of selection, based on the data for the current trial, have been proposed. A review of the literature has shown that these methods can produce misleading inferences. The decision as to which covariates to include in the analysis should be specified in the protocol on the basis of data from previous trials on similar patient populations. The methods are illustrated with data from a trial comparing two therapies for treating scalp psoriasis where the clinical importance of patients' age and sex as prognostic factors for efficacy is unknown. We show for what size of future trials it would be beneficial to adjust for these covariates and for what size trials it would not. In all cases, prespecification of variables to be included in the analysis is essential in order to avoid bias.},

abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a multi-center study assessing neuroimaging in diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring. Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often represents a prodromal form of dementia, conferring a 10-15{\%} annual risk of converting to probable AD. We analyzed baseline 1.5T MRI scans in 693 participants from the ADNI cohort divided into four groups by baseline diagnosis and one year MCI to probable AD conversion status to identify neuroimaging phenotypes associated with MCI and AD and potential predictive markers of imminent conversion. MP-RAGE scans were analyzed using publicly available voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automated parcellation methods. Measures included global and hippocampal grey matter (GM) density, hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, and cortical thickness values from entorhinal cortex and other temporal and parietal lobe regions. The overall pattern of structural MRI changes in MCI (n=339) and AD (n=148) compared to healthy controls (HC, n=206) was similar to prior findings in smaller samples. MCI-Converters (n=62) demonstrated a very similar pattern of atrophic changes to the AD group up to a year before meeting clinical criteria for AD. Finally, a comparison of effect sizes for contrasts between the MCI-Converters and MCI-Stable (n=277) groups on MRI metrics indicated that degree of neurodegeneration of medial temporal structures was the best antecedent MRI marker of imminent conversion, with decreased hippocampal volume (left {\textgreater} right) being the most robust. Validation of imaging biomarkers is important as they can help enrich clinical trials of disease modifying agents by identifying individuals at highest risk for progression to AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure rates of decline in cognition and function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to investigate their accelerating risk factors in Korea.

METHODS: This study presents longitudinal data on a community-based sample of 107 patients with AD, followed at 6 months and 12 months. The cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale (DAD) were given. Mixed model analyses were conducted using the following independent variables: times of repeated assessment (0, 6 or 12 months), severity of dementia assessed by the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) and individual indicators as covariates.

RESULTS: Average annual rates of decline in the MMSE, the ADAS-cog and the DAD were 2.3, 11.4 and 15.1 points, respectively. Neither gender, duration of formal education, nor duration of AD since onset was significant predictors of cognitive and functional decline. Patterns of functional decline in total DAD, instrumental ADLs, planning and organization and performance subscale are linear as MMSE score declines, while those of the basic ADLs and the initiation are curvilinear.

CONCLUSION: This naturalistic observational study measured rates of cognitive and functional decline in AD, and can provide reference data for further longitudinal studies or clinical trials. Further study will be necessary to determine whether linear or curvilinear pattern in functional decline is due to progression of AD itself or statistical artifact.},

Insufficiency in sample size as a result of overestimating the effect size can be destructive to the success of the clinical trial. Sample size re-estimation may need to be properly considered as a part of clinical trial planning. This paper is intended to give the motivations for the sample size re-estimation based partly on the effect size observed at an interim analysis and for a resulting simple adaptive test strategy. The performance of this adaptive design strategy is assessed by comparing it with a fixed maximum sample size design that is properly adjusted in anticipation of the possible sample size adjustment.},

Paired in-person and telephone MMSE observations were collected within 35 days of each other. The setting was the Stanford/VA Alzheimer's Center in Palo Alto, California, and patients' residences. The 30-point Folstein MMSE was administered in-person, and a 26-point telephone version of the MMSE, adapted from the Adult Lifestyles and Function Interview (ALFI)-MMSE. Total scores for the in-person and telephone MMSE versions correlated strongly (Pearson's r =.88, P {\textless}.001). Hearing impairment and education level did not significantly affect telephone-based performance. The Telephone MMSE can be used to validly estimate in-person MMSE scores of patients with AD. Use of this practical measure can enhance reassessment if returning to the clinic is difficult or if a change in the patient's medical condition merits a check of mental status by telephone.},

@article{Alosh2010,
abstract = {In a clinical trial with two clinically important endpoints, each of which can fully characterize a treatment benefit to support an efficacy claim by itself, a minimum degree of consistency in the findings is expected; otherwise interpretation of study findings can be problematic. Clinical trial literature contains examples where lack of consistency in the findings of clinically relevant endpoints led to difficulties in interpreting study results. The aim of this paper is to introduce this consistency concept at the study design stage and investigate the consequences of its implementation in the statistical analysis plan. The proposed methodology allows testing of hierarchically ordered endpoints to proceed as long as a pre-specified consistency criterion is met. In addition, while an initial allocation of the alpha level is specified for the ordered endpoints at the design stage, the methodology allows the alpha level allocated to the second endpoint to be adaptive to the findings of the first endpoint. In addition, the methodology takes into account the correlation between the endpoints in calculating the significance level and the power of the test for the next endpoint. The proposed Consistency-Adjusted Alpha-Adaptive Strategy (CAAAS) is very general. Several of the well-known multiplicity adjustment approaches arise as special cases of this strategy by appropriate selection of the consistency level and the form of alpha-adaptation function. We discuss control of the Type I error rate as well as power of the proposed methodology and consider its application to clinical trial data.},

abstract = {This paper explores the use of simple summary statistics for analysing repeated measurements in randomized clinical trials with two treatments. Quite often the data for each patient may be effectively summarized by a pre-treatment mean and a post-treatment mean. Analysis of covariance is the method of choice and its superiority over analysis of post-treatment means or analysis of mean changes is quantified, as regards both reduced variance and avoidance of bias, using a simple model for the covariance structure between time points. Quantitative consideration is also given to practical issues in the design of repeated measures studies: the merits of having more than one pre-treatment measurement are demonstrated, and methods for determining sample sizes in repeated measures designs are provided. Several examples from clinical trials are presented, and broad practical recommendations are made. The examples support the value of the compound symmetry assumption as a realistic simplification in quantitative planning of repeated measures trials. The analysis using summary statistics makes no such assumption. However, allowance in design for alternative non-equal correlation structures can and should be made when necessary.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common causes of mental deterioration in elderly people, accounting for around 50{\%}- 60{\%} of the overall cases of dementia among persons over 65 years of age. The past two decades have witnessed a considerable research eVort directed towards discover- ing the cause of Alzheimer's disease with the ultimate hope of developing safe and eVective pharmacological treatments. This article examines the existing scientific applicability of the original cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease by de- scribing the biochemical and histopatho- logical changes of neurotransmitter markers that occur in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease both at postmor- tem and neurosurgical cerebral biopsy and the behavioural consequences of cholino- mimetic drugs and cholinergic lesions. Such studies have resulted in the discovery of an association between a decline in learning and memory, and a deficit in exci- tatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmis- sion, together with important roles for the cholinergic system in attentional process- ing and as amodulator ofEAAneurotrans- mission. Accordingly, although there is presently no “cure” for Alzheimer's dis- ease, a large number of potential therapeu- tic interventions have emerged that are designed to correct loss of presynaptic cholinergic function. A few of these com- pounds have confirmed eYcacy in delaying the deterioration of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, a valuable treatment target considering the progressive nature of the disease. Indeed, three compounds have received European approval for the treatment of the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, first tacrine and more recently, donepezil and rivastigmine, all of which are cholinesterase inhibitors.},

The economic burden of Alzheimer's disease is massive; in the United States alone, the estimated direct and indirect annual cost of patient care is at least {\$}100 billion. Current FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease do not prevent or reverse the disease, and provide only modest symptomatic benefits. Driven by the clear unmet medical need and a growing understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, the number of agents in development has increased dramatically in recent years. Truly *'disease-modifying' therapies that target the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease have now reached late stages of human clinical trials. Primary targets include beta-amyloid, whose presence and accumulation in the brain is thought to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease, and tau protein which, when hyperphosphorylated, results in the self-assembly of tangles of paired helical filaments also believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we briefly discuss the current status of Alzheimer's disease therapies under study, as well the scientific context in which they have been developed.},

Mice immunized against amyloid beta and mice infused with anti-amyloid beta antibody (active and passive immunization, respectively) have reduced brain amyloid beta levels, and two mechanisms have been proposed: microglial phagocytosis in the brain and enhancement of amyloid beta efflux by antibodies present in the periphery (sequestration). The optimal antibody for microglial phagocytosis has been shown to be N-terminal-specific antibody; however, the potency of C-terminal-specific antibody in sequestration remains unclear. In this study, we found that anti-amyloid beta 40-specific antibody induces amyloid beta sequestration. These results indicate that C-terminal antibodies may be useful in amyloid beta sequestration therapy.},

abstract = {Background. Self-contained tests estimate and test the association between a phenotype and mean expression level in a gene set defined a priori. Many self-contained gene set analysis methods have been developed but the performance of these methods phenotypes that are continuous rather than discrete and with multiple nuisance covariates has not been well studied. Here, I use Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of both novel and previously published (and readily available via R) methods for inferring effects of a continuous predictor on mean expression in the presence of nuisance covariates. The motivating data are a high-profile dataset which was used to show opposing effects of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being (or happiness) on the mean expression level of a set of genes that has been correlated with social adversity (the CTRA gene set). The original analysis of these data used a linear model (GLS) of fixed effects with correlated error to infer effects of Hedonia and Eudaimonia on mean CTRA expression. Methods. The standardized effects of Hedonia and Eudaiwonia on CTRA gene set expression estimated by GLS were compared to estimates using multivariate (OLS) linear models and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. The OLS estimates were tested using O'Brien's OLS test, Anderson's permutation r(F)(2)-test, two permutation F -tests (including GlobalAncova), and a rotation z -test (Roast). The GEE estimates were tested using a Wald test with robust standard errors. The performancie (Type I, II, S, and M errors) of all tests was investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation of data explicitly modeled on the re-analyzed dataset. Results. GLS estimates are inconsistent between data sets, and, in each dataset, at least one coefficient is large and highly statistically significant. By contrast, effects estimated by OLS or GEE are very small, especially relative to the standard errors. Bootstrap and permutation GLS distributions suggest that the GLS results in downward biased standard errors and inflated coefficients. The Monte Carlo simulation of error rates shows highly inflated Type I error from the GLS test and slightly inflated Type I error from the GEE test. By contrast, Type I error for all OLS tests are at the nominal level, The permutation F -tests have similar to 1,9X the power of the other OLS tests. This increased power comes at a cost of high sign error (similar to 10{\%}) if tested on small effects, Discussion. The apparently repli{\ldots}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of Clinical Data Management Systems (CDMS) has become essential in clinical trials to handle the increasing amount of data that must be collected and analyzed. With a CDMS trial data are captured at investigator sites with "electronic Case Report Forms". Although more and more of these electronic data management systems are used in academic research centres an overview of CDMS products and of available data management and quality management resources for academic clinical trials in Europe is missing.

METHODS: The ECRIN (European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network) data management working group conducted a two-part standardized survey on data management, software tools, and quality management for clinical trials. The questionnaires were answered by nearly 80 centres/units (with an overall response rate of 47{\%} and 43{\%}) from 12 European countries and EORTC.

RESULTS: Our survey shows that about 90{\%} of centres have a CDMS in routine use. Of these CDMS nearly 50{\%} are commercial systems; Open Source solutions don't play a major role. In general, solutions used for clinical data management are very heterogeneous: 20 different commercial CDMS products (7 Open Source solutions) in addition to 17/18 proprietary systems are in use. The most widely employed CDMS products are MACRO and Capture System, followed by solutions that are used in at least 3 centres: eResearch Network, CleanWeb, GCP Base and SAS. Although quality management systems for data management are in place in most centres/units, there exist some deficits in the area of system validation.

CONCLUSIONS: Because the considerable heterogeneity of data management software solutions may be a hindrance to cooperation based on trial data exchange, standards like CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standard Consortium) should be implemented more widely. In a heterogeneous environment the use of data standards can simplify data exchange, increase the quality of data and prepare centres for new developments (e.g. the use of EHR for clinical research). Because data management and the use of electronic data capture systems in clinical trials are characterized by the impact of regulations and guidelines, ethical concerns are discussed. In this context quality management becomes an important part of compliant data management. To address these issues ECRIN will establish certified data centres to support electronic data management and associated compliance needs of clinical trial centres in Europe.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) has been used widely as a cognitive end point in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) clinical trials. Efforts to treat AD pathology at earlier stages have also used ADAS-Cog, but failure in these trials can be difficult to interpret because the scale has well-known ceiling effects that limit its use in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. A wealth of data exists in ADAS-Cog from both historical trials and contemporary longitudinal natural history studies that can provide insights about parts of the scale that may be better suited for MCI and early AD trials.

METHODS: Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study data, we identified the most informative cognitive measures from the ADAS-Cog and other available scales. We used cross-sectional analyses to characterize trajectories of ADAS-Cog and its individual subscales, as well as other cognitive, functional, or global measures across disease stages. Informative measures were identified based on standardized mean of 2-year change from baseline and were combined into novel composite endpoints. We assessed performance of the novel endpoints based on sample size requirements for a 2-year clinical trial. A bootstrap validation procedure was also undertaken to assess the reproducibility of the standardized mean changes of the selected measures and the corresponding composites.

RESULTS: All proposed novel endpoints have improved standardized mean changes and thus improved statistical power compared with the ADAS-Cog 11. Further improvements were achieved by using cognitive-functional composites. Combining the novel composites with an enrichment strategy based on cerebral spinal fluid beta-amyloid (A$\beta$(1-42)) in a 2-year trial yielded gains in power of 20{\%} to 40{\%} over ADAS-Cog 11, regardless of the novel measure considered.

CONCLUSION: An empirical, data-driven approach with existing instruments was used to derive novel composite scales based on ADAS-Cog 11 with improved performance characteristics for MCI and early AD clinical trials. Together with patient enrichment based on A$\beta$(1-42) pathology, these modified endpoints may allow more efficient clinical trials in these populations and can be assessed without modifying current test administration procedures in ongoing trials.},

When either all or some of the column sums are equal, this method substantially reduces the computational effort needed to obtain the exact p-value. The principal computational efficiency is gained from the idea that the network size could be reduced by multiplying the probabilities of equivalent tables in which the first row entries are permutation of each other rather than creating them repeatedly and summing up their probabilities. The ranges of the nodes in the network and the ranges of the arcs emanating from each node to the nodes at the succeeding stages are redefined, so that the algorithm creates only the representatives of equivalent tables which are permutationally distinct without missing any possible table. An equation to calculate the numbers of equivalent tables is given. This method is also applicable to exact Pearson chi-squared and exact likelihood ratio tests. Some numerical examples are presented to compare the computational time of the improved algorithm with the original network algorithm. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

ANOVA tests for the between-groups main effect, groups X times interaction, and differences in linear trends across time periods are shown to be seriously conservative or seriously nonconservative, depending on the direction and significance of chance baseline mean difference. Inclusion of baseline scores as a covariate in the repeated measurements ANOVA provides appropriate correction for the between-groups (average) effect across time, but the covariate provides no correction for the within-subject effects that are concerned with differences in the rates or patterns of change across time. If one desires to evaluate differences between patterns of treatment-induced change, tests of significance for differences in group means on composite trend scores with covariance correction for baseline are recommended. If covariance correction is not or cannot be employed, the potentially "favorable" or "unfavorable" influence of chance baseline differences on tests of significance needs to be explicitly recognized.},

abstract = {Phase II clinical trials are typically designed as two-stage studies, in order to ensure early termination of the trial if the interim results show that the treatment is ineffective. Most of two-stage designs, developed under both a frequentist and a Bayesian framework, select the second stage sample size before observing the first stage data. This may cause some paradoxical situations during the practical carrying out of the trial. To avoid these potential problems, we suggest a Bayesian predictive strategy to derive an adaptive two-stage design, where the second stage sample size is not selected in advance, but depends on the first stage result. The criterion we propose is based on a modification of a Bayesian predictive design recently presented in the literature (see (Statist. Med. 2008; 27:1199-1224)). The distinction between analysis and design priors is essential for the practical implementation of the procedure: some guidelines for choosing these prior distributions are discussed and their impact on the required sample size is examined.},

Bayesian analyses use available patient-outcome information, including biomarkers that accumulating data indicate might be related to clinical outcome.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since 1990 non communicable diseases and injuries account for the majority of death and disability-adjusted life years in Latin America. We analyzed the relationship between the global burden of disease and Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) conducted in Latin America that were published in the five leading medical journals.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included all RCTS in humans, exclusively conducted in Latin American countries, and published in any of the following journals: Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine. We described the trials and reported the number of RCTs according to the main categories of the global burden of disease. Sixty-six RCTs were identified. Communicable diseases accounted for 38 (57{\%}) reports. Maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions accounted for 19 (29{\%}) trials. Non-communicable diseases represent 48{\%} of the global burden of disease but only 14{\%} of reported trials. No trial addressed injuries despite its 18{\%} contribution to the burden of disease in 2000.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A poor correlation between the burden of disease and RCTs publications was found. Non communicable diseases and injuries account for up to two thirds of the burden of disease in Latin America but these topics are seldom addressed in published RCTs in the selected sample of journals. Funding bodies of health research and editors should be aware of the increasing burden of non communicable diseases and injuries occurring in Latin America to ensure that this growing epidemic is not neglected in the research agenda and not affected by publication bias.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, accounting for 60-70{\%} of all cases [Hebert et al., 2003, 1]. The need for effective therapies for AD is great. Current approaches, including cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, are symptomatic treatments for AD but do not prevent disease progression. Many diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to AD are currently changing due to the knowledge that underlying pathology starts 10 to 20. years before clinical signs of dementia appear [Holtzman et al., 2011, 2]. New therapies which focus on prevention or delay of the onset or cognitive symptoms are needed. Recent advances in the identification of AD biomarkers now make it possible to detect AD pathology in the preclinical stage of the disease, in cognitively normal (CN) individuals; this biomarker data should be used in the selection of high-risk populations for clinical trials. In vivo visualization of AD neuropathology and biological, biochemical or physiological confirmation of the effects of treatment likely will substantially improve development of novel pharmaceuticals. Positron emission tomography (PET) is the leading neuroimaging tool to detect and provide quantitative measures of AD amyloid pathology in vivo at the early stages and follow its course longitudinally.

abstract = {The selection of a trial design is an important issue in the planning of clinical trials. One of the most important considerations in trial design is the method of treatment allocation and appropriate analysis plan corresponding to the design. In this article, we conducted computer simulations using the actual data from 2158 rectal cancer patients enrolled in the surgery-alone group from seven randomized controlled trials in Japan to compare the performance of allocation methods, simple randomization, stratified randomization and minimization in relatively small-scale trials (total number of two groups are 50, 100, 150 or 200 patients). The degree of imbalance in prognostic factors between groups was evaluated by changing the allocation probability of minimization from 1.00 to 0.70 by 0.05. The simulation demonstrated that minimization provides the best performance to ensure balance in the number of patients between groups and prognostic factors. Moreover, to achieve the 1 percentile for the p-value of chi-square test around 0.50 with respect to balance in prognostic factors, the allocation probability of minimization was required to be set to 0.95 for 50, 0.80 for 100, 0.75 for 150 and 0.70 for 200 patients. When the sample size was larger, sufficient balance could be achieved even if reducing allocation probability. The simulation using actual data demonstrated that unadjusted tests for the allocation factors resulted in conservative type I errors when dynamic allocation, such as minimization, was used. In contrast, adjusted tests for allocation factors as covariates improved type I errors closer to the nominal significance level and they provided slightly higher power. In conclusion, both the statistical and clinical validity of minimization was demonstrated in our study.},

Correlation or clustering, resulting from the similarity of outcomes among patients within a center, requires an adjustment to confidence intervals and P values, especially in observational studies and in randomized multicenter studies in which treatment is allocated by center rather than by individual patient. Multicenter designs also warrant testing and adjustment for the potential bias of confounding by center, and for the presence of effect modification or interaction by center.

abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have led to the development of putative disease-modifying treatments. The most revolutionary of these approaches consists in the removal of brain -amyloid (A) via anti-A antibodies. Brain imaging and neuropathological studies have shown the ability of both active and passive anti-A immunotherapies of clearing A deposits from the brain of the AD patients. An active anti-A vaccine preparation, AN1792, has been used in AD patients with some clues of clinical efficacy but causing meningoencephalitis in about 6{\%} of patients and it has been abandoned. Several second-generation active A vaccines and passive A immunotherapies have been developed and are under clinical investigation with the aim of accelerating A clearance from the brain of the AD patients. The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, composed of humanized anti-A monoclonal antibodies, that has been tested in two Phase II trials, demonstrating to reduce A burden in the brain of AD patients. However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain. The occurrence of vasogenic edema, especially in apolipoprotein E 4 carriers, may limit its clinical use and have led to abandon the highest dose of the drug (2 mg/kg). The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab will tell us if passive anti-A immunization is able to alter the course if this devastating disease.},

We aim to identify the subsets of the most informative items from an existing cognitive battery to better power clinical trials on early AD. METHODS Longitudinal change in item scores from the battery was associated with the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in 1,513 elderly individuals. Items whose longitudinal changes were correlated with the onset of MCI were selected as informative for tracking the early cognitive progression. RESULTS 226 items in the battery were annually assessed over a follow-up of up to 13 years. Changes of item scores over time from 187 items were significantly correlated with the onset of MCI. For clinical trials on preclinical AD and on MCI, informative items permit smaller or similar sample sizes as compared to the entire battery, whereas uninformative items require much larger sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS Longitudinal changes in item scores from about 17{\%} of items in the cognitive battery are uninformative for tracking early disease progression. Clinical trials on early AD can be better powered using informative items rather than the entire battery.},

Methods: Longitudinal change from baseline (14-item version of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale) was simulated for treatment/placebo from multivariate normal distributions with the variance-covariance matrix estimated from solanezumab trial data. Type I error, power, and bias were based on 18-month treatment contrast. Sample sizes included 500 and 1000 patients/arm. Results: The slope model was more powerful in most scenarios. Mixed-model repeated measure was relatively unbiased in parameter estimation. The slope model yielded unbiased estimates whenever the underlying trajectory was not detectably different from linear. Both methods led to similar type I error. Discussion: In clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease, mixed-model repeated measure analysis with relaxed assumptions on disease progression seems to be preferred. The slope model might be more powerful if the trajectory has little departure from linearity.},

abstract = {Introduction: New treatments for neurodegenerative disease are urgently needed, and clinical trial methods are an essential component of new drug development. Although a parallel-group study design for neurological disorder clinical trials is commonly used to test the effectiveness of a new treatment as compared to placebo, it does not efficiently use information from the on-going study to increase the success rate of a trial or to stop a trial earlier when the new treatment is indeed ineffective. Methods: We review some recent advances in designs for clinical trials, including futility designs and adaptive designs. Results: Futility designs and noninferiority designs are used to test the nonsuperiority and the noninferiority of a new treatment, respectively. We provide some guidance on using these two designs and analyzing data from these studies properly. Adaptive designs are increasingly used in clinical trials to improve the flexibility and efficiency of trials with the potential to reduce resources, time, and costs. We review some typical adaptive designs and new statistical methods to handle the statistical challenges from adaptive designs. Discussion: Statistical advances in clinical trial designs may be helpful to shorten study length and benefit more patients being treated with a better treatment during the discovery of new therapies for neurological disorders. Advancing statistical underpinnings of neuroscience research is a critical aspect of the core activities supported by the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence award supporting the Center for Neurodegeneration and Translational Neuroscience.},

In this study, we pre-sent the extension of the previous work for variants with multiple alleles. A full enumeration algorithm is used for the exact calculations of tri-allelic variants. For variants with many alternate alleles, we use a permutation test. Some empirical examples with data from the 1,000 genomes project are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of adaptive sample size re-estimation for phase 3 confirmatory clinical trials. Comparisons are made with more traditional fixed sample and group sequential designs. It is seen that the real benefit of the adaptive approach arises through the ability to invest sample size resources into the trial in stages. The trial starts with a small up-front sample size commitment. Additional sample size resources are committed to the trial only if promising results are obtained at an interim analysis. This strategy is shown through examples of actual trials, one in neurology and one in cardiology, to be more advantageous than the fixed sample or group sequential approaches in certain settings. A major factor that has generated controversy and inhibited more widespread use of these methods has been their reliance on non-standard tests and p-values for preserving the type-1 error. If, however, the sample size is only increased when interim results are promising, one can dispense with these non-standard methods of inference. Therefore, in the spirit of making adaptive increases in trial size more widely appealing and readily implementable we here define those promising circumstances in which a conventional final inference can be performed while preserving the overall type-1 error. Methodological, regulatory and operational issues are examined.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Red meat consumption has been associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases. However, its relationship with mortality remains uncertain.

METHODS: We prospectively observed 37 698 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2008) and 83 644 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2008) who were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer at baseline. Diet was assessed by validated food frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 years.

RESULTS: We documented 23 926 deaths (including 5910 CVD and 9464 cancer deaths) during 2.96 million person-years of follow-up. After multivariate adjustment for major lifestyle and dietary risk factors, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) (95{\%} CI) of total mortality for a 1-serving-per-day increase was 1.13 (1.07-1.20) for unprocessed red meat and 1.20 (1.15-1.24) for processed red meat. The corresponding HRs (95{\%} CIs) were 1.18 (1.13-1.23) and 1.21 (1.13-1.31) for CVD mortality and 1.10 (1.06-1.14) and 1.16 (1.09-1.23) for cancer mortality. We estimated that substitutions of 1 serving per day of other foods (including fish, poultry, nuts, legumes, low-fat dairy, and whole grains) for 1 serving per day of red meat were associated with a 7{\%} to 19{\%} lower mortality risk. We also estimated that 9.3{\%} of deaths in men and 7.6{\%} in women in these cohorts could be prevented at the end of follow-up if all the individuals consumed fewer than 0.5 servings per day (approximately 42 g/d) of red meat.

CONCLUSIONS: Red meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of total, CVD, and cancer mortality. Substitution of other healthy protein sources for red meat is associated with a lower mortality risk.},

Comparisons were made in simulated data and in data from a randomized clinical trial. Subject dropout was introduced in the simulated data to generate ignorable and nonignorable missingness. Estimates of treatment group differences in mean change from baseline to endpoint from MMRM were, on average, markedly closer to the true value than estimates from LOCF in every scenario simulated. Standard errors and confidence intervals from MMRM accurately reflected the uncertainty of the estimates, whereas standard errors and confidence intervals from LOCF underestimated uncertainty.},

RESULTS: If the correlation between the outcome measured at baseline and at follow-up is rho, ANCOVA comparing groups of (1-rho(2))n subjects has the same power as t-test comparing groups of n subjects. When on the same data, ANCOVA is used instead of t-test, the precision of the treatment estimate is increased, and the length of the confidence interval is reduced by a factor 1-rho(2).

CONCLUSION: ANCOVA may considerably reduce the number of patients required for a trial.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize quantitative florbetapir F 18 (hereafter referred to as simply florbetapir) positron emission tomographic (PET) measurements of fibrillar $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) burden in a large clinical cohort of participants with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and older healthy controls (OHCs).

DESIGN: Cerebral-to-whole-cerebellar florbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were computed. Mean cortical SUVRs were compared. A threshold of SUVRs greater than or equal to 1.17 was used to reflect pathological levels of amyloid associated with AD based on separate antemortem PET and postmortem neuropathology data from 19 end-of-life patients. Similarly, a threshold of SUVRs greater than 1.08 was used to signify the presence of any identifiable A$\beta$ because this was the upper limit from a separate set of 46 individuals 18 to 40 years of age who did not carry apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4.

SETTING: Multiple research imaging centers.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 68 participants with probable AD, 60 participants with MCI, and 82 OHCs who were 55 years of age or older. Main Outcome Measure Florbetapir-PET activity.

RESULTS: All of the participants (ie, those with probable AD or MCI and those who were OHCs) differed significantly in mean (SD) cortical florbetapir SUVRs (1.39 [0.24], 1.17 [0.27], and 1.05 [0.16], respectively; P {\textless} 1.0 × 10⁻⁷), in percentage meeting levels of amyloid associated with AD by SUVR criteria (80.9{\%}, 40.0{\%}, and 20.7{\%}, respectively; P {\textless} 1.0 × 10⁻⁷), and in percentage meeting SUVR criteria for the presence of any identifiable A$\beta$ (85.3{\%}, 46.6{\%}, and 28.1{\%}, respectively; P {\textless} 1.0 × 10⁻⁷). Among OHCs, the percentage of florbetapir positivity increased linearly by age decile (P = .05). For the 54 OHCs with available APOE genotypes, APOE $\epsilon$4 carriers had a higher mean (SD) cortical SUVR than did noncarriers (1.14 [0.2] vs 1.03 [0.16]; P = .048).

CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our analysis confirm the ability of florbetapir-PET SUVRs to characterize amyloid levels in clinically probable AD, MCI, and OHC groups using continuous and binary measures of fibrillar A$\beta$ burden. It introduces criteria to determine whether an image is associated with an intermediate-to-high likelihood of pathologic AD or with having any identifiable cortical amyloid level above that seen in low-risk young controls.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are no published guidelines for use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring data by a patient; we therefore developed the DirecNet Applied Treatment Algorithm (DATA). The DATA provides algorithms for making diabetes management decisions using glucose values: (i) in real time which include the direction and rate of change of glucose levels, and (ii) retrospectively based on downloaded sensor data.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use and effectiveness of the DATA in children with diabetes using a real-time continuous glucose sensor (the FreeStyle Navigator).

SUBJECTS: Thirty children and adolescents (mean +/- standard deviation age = 11.2 +/- 4.1 yr) receiving insulin pump therapy.

METHODS: Subjects were instructed on use of the DATA and were asked to download their Navigator weekly to review glucose patterns. An Algorithm Satisfaction Questionnaire was completed at 3, 7, and 13 wk.

RESULTS: At 13 wk, all of the subjects and all but one parent thought that the DATA gave good, clear directions for insulin dosing, and thought the guidelines improved their postprandial glucose levels. In responding to alarms, 86{\%} of patients used the DATA at least 50{\%} of the time at 3 wk, and 59{\%} reported doing so at 13 wk. Similar results were seen in using the DATA to adjust premeal bolus doses of insulin.

CONCLUSIONS: These results show the feasibility of implementing the DATA when real-time continuous glucose monitoring is initiated and support its use in future clinical trials of real-time continuous glucose monitoring.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 - IOS Press and the authors. A variety of imaging, neuropsychological, and genetic biomarkers have been suggested as potential biomarkers for the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients who later develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we systematically evaluated the most promising combinations of these biomarkers regarding discrimination between stable and converter MCI and reflection of disease staging. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data of AD (n=144), controls (n=112), stable (n=265) and converter (n=177) MCI, for which apolipoprotein E status, neuropsychological evaluation, and structural, glucose, and amyloid imaging were available, were included in this study. Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifiers were built on AD and controls data for all possible combinations of these biomarkers, with and without stratification by amyloid status. All classifiers were then applied to the MCI cohorts. We obtained an accuracy of 76 for discrimination between converter and stable MCI with glucose positron emission tomography as a single biomarker. This accuracy increased to about 87 when including further imaging modalities and genetic information. We also identified several biomarker combinations as strong predictors of time to conversion. Use of amyloid validated training data resulted in increased  sensitivities and decreased specificities for differentiation between stable and converter MCI when amyloid was included as a biomarker but not for other classifier combinations. Our results indicate that fully independent classifiers built only on AD and controls data and combining imaging, genetic, and/or neuropsychological biomarkers can more reliably discriminate between stable and converter MCI than single modality classifiers. Several biomarker combinations are identified as strongly predictive for the time to conversion to AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variations exist in the surgical techniques used for caesarean section and many have not been rigorously assessed in randomised controlled trials. We aimed to assess whether any surgical techniques were associated with improved outcomes for women and babies.

METHODS: CORONIS was a pragmatic international 2×2×2×2×2 non-regular fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial that examined five elements of the caesarean section technique in intervention pairs. CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan. Each site was assigned to three of the five intervention pairs: blunt versus sharp abdominal entry; exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair; single-layer versus double-layer closure of the uterus; closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal); and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 for uterine repair. Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision. Women were randomly assigned by a secure web-based number allocation system to one intervention from each of the three assigned pairs. All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion ({\textgreater}1 unit) up to the 6-week follow-up visit. Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated. The CORONIS Trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN31089967.

FINDINGS: Between May 20, 2007, and Dec 31, 2010, 15 935 women were recruited. There were no statistically significant differences within any of the intervention pairs for the primary outcome: blunt versus sharp entry risk ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}03 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}91-1{\textperiodcentered}17), exterior versus intra-abdominal repair 0{\textperiodcentered}96 (0{\textperiodcentered}84-1{\textperiodcentered}08), single-layer versus double-layer closure 0{\textperiodcentered}96 (0{\textperiodcentered}85-1{\textperiodcentered}08), closure versus non-closure 1{\textperiodcentered}06 (0{\textperiodcentered}94-1{\textperiodcentered}20), and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 0{\textperiodcentered}90 (0{\textperiodcentered}78-1{\textperiodcentered}04). 144 serious adverse events were reported, of which 26 were possibly related to the intervention. Most of the reported serious adverse events were known complications of surgery or complications of the reasons for the caesarean section.

INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that any of these surgical techniques is acceptable. However, longer-term follow-up is needed to assess whether the absence of evidence of short-term effects will translate into an absence of long-term effects.

We aimed to investigate if the combination of baseline MRI and CSF could enhance the classification of AD compared to using either alone and predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion at multiple future time points. 369 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included in the study (AD=96, MCI=162 and CTL=111). Freesurfer was used to generate regional subcortical volumes and cortical thickness measures. A total of 60 variables were used for orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS) multivariate analysis (57 MRI measures and 3 CSF measures: A$\beta$(42), t-tau and p-tau). Combining MRI and CSF gave the best results for distinguishing AD vs. CTL. We found an accuracy of 91.8{\%} for the combined model at baseline compared to 81.6{\%} for CSF measures and 87.0{\%} for MRI measures alone. The combined model also gave the best accuracy when distinguishing between MCI vs. CTL (77.6{\%}) at baseline. MCI subjects who converted to AD by 12 and 18month follow-up were accurately predicted at baseline using an AD vs. CTL model (82.9{\%} and 86.4{\%} respectively), with lower prediction accuracies for those MCI subjects converting by 24 and 36month follow up (75.4{\%} and 68.0{\%} respectively). The overall prediction accuracies for converters and non-converters ranged from 58.6{\%} to 66.4{\%} at different time points. Combining MRI and CSF measures in a multivariate model at baseline gave better accuracy for discriminating between AD and CTL, between MCI and CTL and for predicting future conversion from MCI to AD, than using either MRI or CSF separately.},

The aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date account of the theory and methodological developments underlying the applications of finite mixture models. Because of their flexibility, mixture models are being increasingly exploited as a convenient, semiparametric way in which to model unknown distributional shapes. This is in addition to their obvious applications where there is group-structure in the data or where the aim is to explore the data for such structure, as in a cluster analysis. It has now been three decades since the publication of the monograph by McLachlan {\&} Basford (1988) with an emphasis on the potential usefulness of mixture models for inference and clustering. Since then, mixture models have attracted the interest of many researchers and have found many new and interesting fields of application. Thus, the literature on mixture models has expanded enormously, and as a consequence, the bibliography here can only provide selected coverage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of double-blind designs, normally the criterion standard of clinical trials, is impossible when comparing medication therapy to procedural therapies for depression. In the Consortium for Research in Electroconvulsive Therapy (CORE) trial, depressed patients recently remitted with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) were randomly assigned to receive continuation therapy with either ECT or medications. The purpose of this article is to describe the design characteristics and challenges of the trial and of our method of dealing with the lack of double-blind outcome assessment.

METHODS: The primary outcome measure was time to relapse of depression in the continuation phase. We developed a method to achieve partial blinding of depressive severity assessment. This consisted of videotaping the structured interviews, having the video tapes co-rated by personnel not involved in the patient's care, and a videotape-tracking maneuver so that the assessor of the videotapes could be blinded to phase and type of treatment.

RESULTS: We enrolled 624 patients into the initial treatment phase of the trial. Of these, 201 met criteria for randomization into the second, continuation phase. Our videotape-tracking maneuver to reduce bias in outcome assessment worked well during the trial.

CONCLUSIONS: The CORE study is the first multicenter, randomized controlled trial of continuation ECT in the relapse prevention of major depressive episodes. We successfully recruited a large number of severely depressed patients into a 6 month trial and used a method of reducing bias that might result from lack of blinding.},

abstract = {Introduction: The definition of “objective cognitive impairment” in current criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) varies considerably between research groups and clinics. This study aims to compare different methods of defining memory impairment to improve prediction models for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from baseline to 24 months. Methods: The sensitivity and specificity of six methods of defining episodic memory impairment ({\textless} .1, .1.5 or .2 standard deviations [SD] on one or two memory tests) were compared in 494 non-demented seniors from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using the area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic analysis. The added value of non-memory measures (language and executive function) and biomarkers (hippocampal and white-matter hyperintensity volume, brain parenchymal fraction [BPF], and APOE{\aa}4 status) was investigated using logistic regression. Results: Baseline scores {\textless} .1 SD on two memory tests predicted AD with 75.91 {\%} accuracy (AUC = 0.80). Only APOE {\aa}4 status further improved prediction (B = 1.10, SE = 0.45, p = .016). A{\textless}.1.5 SD cut-off on one test had 66.60 {\%} accuracy (AUC = 0.77). Prediction was further improved using Trails B/A ratio (B = 0.27, SE = 0.13, p = .033), BPF (B = .15.97, SE = 7.58, p = .035), and APOE{\aa}4 status (B = 1.08, SE = 0.45, p = .017). A cut-off of {\textless} .2 SD on one memory test (AUC = 0.77, SE = 0.03, 95 {\%} CI 0.72-0.82) had 76.52 {\%} accuracy in predicting AD. Trails B/A ratio (B = 0.31, SE = 0.13, p = .017) and APOE {\aa}4 status (B = 1.07, SE = 0.46, p = .019) improved predictive accuracy. Conclusions: Episodic memory impairment in MCI should be defined as scores {\textless} .1 SD below normative references on at least two measures. Clinicians or researchers who administer a single test should opt for a more stringent cut-off and collect and analyze whole-brain volume. When feasible, ascertaining APOE {\aa}4 status can further improve prediction.},

abstract = {Introduction: Clinicians need to predict prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and researchers need models of progression to develop biomarkers and clinical trials designs. We tested a calculated initial progression rate to see whether it predicted performance on cognition, function and behavior over time, and to see whether it predicted survival. Methods: We used standardized approaches to assess baseline characteristics and to estimate disease duration, and calculated the initial (pre-progression) rate in 597 AD patients followed for up to 15 years. We designated slow, intermediate and rapidly progressing groups. Using mixed eff ects regression analysis, we examined the predictive value of a pre-progression group for longitudinal performance on standardized measures. We used Cox survival analysis to compare survival time by progression group. Results: Patients in the slow and intermediate groups maintained better performance on the cognitive (ADAScog and VSAT), global (CDR-SB) and complex activities of daily living measures (IADL) (P values {\textless}0.001 slow versus fast; P values {\textless}0.003 to 0.03 intermediate versus fast). Interaction terms indicated that slopes of ADAScog and PSMS change for the slow group were smaller than for the fast group, and that rates of change on the ADAScog were also slower for the intermediate group, but that CDR-SB rates increased in this group relative to the fast group. Slow progressors survived longer than fast progressors (P = 0.024). Conclusions: A simple, calculated progression rate at the initial visit gives reliable information regarding performance over time on cognition, global performance and activities of daily living. The slowest progression group also survives longer. This baseline measure should be considered in the design of long duration Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.},

abstract = {Background: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) is a commonly used measure for assessing cognitive dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The measure has 11 subscales, each of which captures an important aspect of cognitive dysfunction in AD. Traditional scoring of the ADAS-cog involves adding up the scores from the subscales without regarding their varying difficulty or their strength of relationship to AD-associated cognitive dysfunction. The present article analyzes problems associated with this approach and offers solutions for gaining measurement precision by modeling how the subscales function. Methods: We analyzed data collected at the Baylor College of Medicine Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders Clinic from 1240 patients diagnosed with varying degrees of dementia. Item response theory was used to determine the relationship between total scores on the ADAS-cog and the underlying level of cognitive dysfunction reflected by the scores. Results: Results revealed that each total score corresponded to a spectrum of cognitive dysfunction, indicating that total scores were relatively imprecise indicators of underlying cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, it was common for two individuals with the same total score to have significantly different degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Conclusions: These findings suggest that item response theory scoring of the ADAS-cog may measure cognitive dysfunction more precisely than a total score method. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Alzheimer's Association.

@article{Borm2005d,
abstract = {Although minimisation methods have frequently been advocated for treatment allocation in clinical trials, they are not widely used. As this may partly be due to the complexity of the methods, we devised a new and simple minimisation method to balance for prognostic factors, called sequential balancing. Each factor is dealt with sequentially and when a new subject enters the trial, he or she is allocated the treatment that leads to improved balance of the first factor over the treatments. If the balance of the first factor was already satisfactory, then the treatment is allocated that leads to improved balance of the second factor and so on. The algorithm requires no calculations. We simulated a realistic trial and compared the performance of this method to the performance of alternative allocation strategies: the variance minimisation method, simple randomisation and stratification. The sequential balancing method led to better balance than randomisation and stratification. In the case of four factors or less, the performance of the sequential balancing method and the variance minimisation method were comparable and the sequence of the factors was not very relevant. When more factors were introduced, the balance of the sequential method remained comparable with the balance achieved with the variance minimisation method for the first four factors, but it started to decrease from the fifth factor onwards. We conclude that the ease and simplicity of the new method make it an attractive option when balance is required for four factors or less. If there are more than four factors, the sequential balancing method may still be an acceptable option, but the advantage of simplicity has to be weighed against the loss of performance compared to other minimisation methods.},

In practice, many disease processes such as Alzheimer can be naturally classified into three diagnostic categories such as normal, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and for such diseases the volume under the ROC surface (VUS) is the most commonly used index of diagnostic accuracy.

Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving forward with research on missing data and attrition.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a late-life dementia risk index that can accurately stratify older adults into those with a low, moderate, or high risk of developing dementia within 6 years.

METHODS: Subjects were 3,375 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study without evidence of dementia at baseline. We used logistic regression to identify those factors most predictive of developing incident dementia within 6 years and developed a point system based on the logistic regression coefficients.

RESULTS: Subjects had a mean age of 76 years at baseline; 59{\%} were women and 15{\%} were African American. Fourteen percent (n = 480) developed dementia within 6 years. The final late-life dementia risk index included older age (1-2 points), poor cognitive test performance (2-4 points), body mass index {\textless}18.5 (2 points), {\textgreater} or =1 apolipoprotein E epsilon4 alleles (1 point), cerebral MRI findings of white matter disease (1 point) or ventricular enlargement (1 point), internal carotid artery thickening on ultrasound (1 point), history of bypass surgery (1 point), slow physical performance (1 point), and lack of alcohol consumption (1 point) (c statistic, 0.81; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.79-0.83). Four percent of subjects with low scores developed dementia over 6 years compared with 23{\%} of subjects with moderate scores and 56{\%} of subjects with high scores.

CONCLUSIONS: The late-life dementia risk index accurately stratified older adults into those with low, moderate, and high risk of developing dementia. This tool could be used in clinical or research settings to target prevention and intervention strategies toward high-risk individuals.},

However, there are concerns about its use in early-stage disease. Herein we examine those concerns using traditional psychometric methods. Methods: We analyzed ADAS-Cog data (n = 675) based on six psychometric properties: data completeness; scaling assumptions; targeting; reliability; validity; and responsiveness. Results: At the scale-level, criteria tested for data completeness, scaling assumptions (item total correlations 0.33-0.59), targeting (no floor/ceiling effects), reliability (Cronbach's $\alpha$ = 0.74), and validity (correlation with MMSE = -0.70) were satisfied. Responsiveness (baseline to 12 months; n = 145) was moderate to high (effect size = -0.73). However, 8 of 11 ADAS-Cog components had substantial ceiling effects (range 32{\%}-83{\%}), and decreased responsiveness associated with low to moderate effect sizes (0.14-0.65). Conclusion: In our study, many patients with AD found large portions of the ADAS-Cog too easy. Future research should consider modifying the ADAS-Cog or developing a new test. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.},

This study was developed by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), a consortium of clinical research centers actively involved in AD research. The major goal of the consortium is to design and conduct clinical investigations leading to the development of treatments for AD. This study uses a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial, parallel group design to test two drugs for the treatment of AD. The primary outcome of the study is the time to reach any one of the following four endpoints: death, institutionalization, loss of two of three basic activities of daily living, and progression of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stage from 2 to 3. Patients with moderately severe disease (CDR = 2) were enrolled and evaluated 10 times over a period of 2 years to determine if these agents reduce the time to reach any endpoint. A database from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease indicated adequate power analyses to observe a treatment effect on this clinically meaningful outcome measure. Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the population are provided. The rationale for the choice of a factorial design, the use of a novel, clinically meaningful endpoint, and the selection of a cohort of patients with AD of moderate severity are discussed.},

abstract = {While neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by steady degeneration over relatively long timelines, it is widely believed that the early stages are the most promising for therapeutic intervention, before irreversible neuronal loss occurs. Developing a therapeutic response requires a precise measure of disease progression. However, since the early stages are for the most part asymptomatic, obtaining accurate measures of disease progression is difficult. Longitudinal databases of hundreds of subjects observed during several years with tens of validated biomarkers are becoming available, allowing the use of computational methods. We propose a widely applicable statistical methodology for creating a disease progression score (DPS), using multiple biomarkers, for subjects with a neurodegenerative disease. The proposed methodology was evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the publicly available AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, yielding an Alzheimer's DPS or ADPS score for each subject and each time-point in the database. In addition, a common description of biomarker changes was produced allowing for an ordering of the biomarkers. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall was found to be the earliest biomarker to become abnormal. The group of biomarkers comprising the volume of the hippocampus and the protein concentration amyloid beta and Tau were next in the timeline, and these were followed by three cognitive biomarkers. The proposed methodology thus has potential to stage individuals according to their state of disease progression relative to a population and to deduce common behaviors of biomarkers in the disease itself.},

We compare the power to detect a treatment effect using either rate of change, as estimated by linear models of longitudinal continuous data, or time-to-event estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. We propose an analytic inflation factor for comparing the two types of analyses assuming that the time-to-event can be expressed as a time-to-threshold of the continuous measure. We conduct simulations based on a publicly available Alzheimer's disease data set in which the time-to-event is algorithmically defined based on a battery of assessments. A Cox proportional hazards model of the time-to-event endpoint is compared to a linear model of a single assessment from the battery. The simulations also explore the impact of baseline covariates in either analysis.},

abstract = {Background Development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly focused on more mildly affected populations, and requires new assessment and outcome strategies. Patients in early stages of AD have mild cognitive decline and no, or limited, functional impairment. To respond to these assessment challenges, we developed a measurement approach based on established scale items that exhibited change in previous amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) trials. Methods Partial least squares regression with a longitudinal clinical decline model identified items from commonly used clinical scales with the highest combined sensitivity to change over time in aMCI and weighted these items according to their relative contribution to detecting clinical progression in patients' early stages of AD. The resultant AD Composite Score (ADCOMS) was assessed for its ability to detect treatment effect in aMCI/prodromal AD (pAD) clinical trial populations. Results ADCOMS consists of 4 Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale items, 2 Mini-Mental State Examination items, and all 6 Clinical Dementia Rating—Sum of Boxes items. ADCOMS demonstrated improved sensitivity to clinical decline over individual scales in pAD, aMCI and in mild AD dementia. ADCOMS also detected treatment effects associated with the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in these populations. Improved sensitivity predicts smaller sample size requirements when ADCOMS is used in early AD trials. Conclusions ADCOMS is proposed as new standard outcome for pAD and mild AD dementia trials, and is progressing in a CAMD-sponsored qualification process for use in registration trials of pAD.},

@misc{Panza2012,
abstract = {The exact mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown, limiting the identification of effective disease-modifying therapies. The two principal neuropathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$), peptide deposition (senile plaques) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. During the last decade, most of the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry were directed against the production and accumulation of A$\beta$. The most innovative of the pharmacological approaches was the stimulation of A$\beta$ clearance from the brain of AD patients via the administration of A$\beta$ antigens (active vaccination) or anti-A$\beta$ antibodies (passive vaccination). Several active and passive anti-A$\beta$ vaccines are under clinical investigation. Unfortunately, the first active vaccine (AN1792, consisting of preaggregate A$\beta$ and an immune adjuvant, QS-21) was abandoned because it caused meningoencephalitis in approximately 6{\%} of treated patients. Anti-A$\beta$ monoclonal antibodies (bapineuzumab and solanezumab) are now being developed. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E $\epsilon$4 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the A$\beta$ peptide. Solanezumab, a humanized anti-A$\beta$ monoclonal antibody directed against the midregion of the A$\beta$ peptide, was shown to neutralize soluble A$\beta$ species. Phase II studies showed a good safety profile of solanezumab, while studies on cerebrospinal and plasma biomarkers documented good signals of pharmacodynamic activity. Although some studies suggested that active immunization may be effective against tau in animal models of AD, very few studies regarding passive immunization against tau protein are currently available. The results of the large, ongoing Phase III trials with bapineuzumab and solanezumab will tell us if monoclonal anti-A$\beta$ antibodies may slow down the rate of deterioration of AD. Based on the new diagnostic criteria of AD and on recent major failures of anti-A$\beta$ drugs in mild-to-moderate AD patients, one could argue that clinical trials on potential disease-modifying drugs, including immunological approaches, should be performed in the early stages of AD.},

abstract = {There is no consensus on the approach to compute the power and sample size with logistic regression. Some authors use the likelihood ratio test; some use the test on proportions; some suggest various approximations to handle the multivariate case. We advocate the use of the Wald test since the Z-score is routinely used for statistical significance testing of regression coefficients. The null-variance formula became popular from early studies, which contradicts modern software, which utilizes the method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), when the variance of the MLE is estimated at the MLE, not at the null. We derive general Wald-based power and sample size formulas for logistic regression and then apply them to binary exposure and confounder to obtain a closed-form expression. These formulas are applied to minimize the total sample size in a case-control study to achieve a given power by optimizing the ratio of controls to cases. Approximately, the optimal number of controls to cases is equal to the square root of the alternative odds ratio.

Although there is broad consensus that Alzheimer's disease (AD) should be treated during its earliest stages, the concept of secondary prevention has evolved to be described more accurately as treatment of preclinical, presymptomatic, or early AD. There continues to be a strong emphasis on biomarkers and a need for new biomarkers; however, there has also been a realization, based on completed trials, that the most reliable indicator of clinical efficacy across the entire spectrum of disease from asymptomatic to AD dementia is likely a measure of cognition. The task force made many recommendations that should improve the likelihood of success in future trials, including larger phase 2 or combined phase 2/phase 3 studies, clear evidence of target engagement in the central nervous system, evidence of downstream effects on biomarkers before initiating phase 3 studies, consideration of adaptive and targeted trial designs, and use of sensitive measures of cognition as the most robust indicator of treatment benefit.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The versatility of DNA copy number amplifications for profiling and categorization of various tissue samples has been widely acknowledged in the biomedical literature. For instance, this type of measurement techniques provides possibilities for exploring sets of cancerous tissues to identify novel subtypes. The previously utilized statistical approaches to various kinds of analyses include traditional algorithmic techniques for clustering and dimension reduction, such as independent and principal component analyses, hierarchical clustering, as well as model-based clustering using maximum likelihood estimation for latent class models. RESULTS: While purely algorithmic methods are usually easily applicable, their suboptimal performance and limitations in making formal inference have been thoroughly discussed in the statistical literature. Here we introduce a Bayesian model-based approach to simultaneous identification of underlying tissue groups and the informative amplifications. The model-based approach provides the possibility of using formal inference to determine the number of groups from the data, in contrast to the ad hoc methods often exploited for similar purposes. The model also automatically recognizes the chromosomal areas that are relevant for the clustering. CONCLUSION: Validatory analyses of simulated data and a large database of DNA copy number amplifications in human neoplasms are used to illustrate the potential of our approach. Our software implementation BASTA for performing Bayesian statistical tissue profiling is freely available for academic purposes at (http://web.abo.fi/fak/mnf/mate/jc/software/basta.html).},

The presence of two or more primary endpoints in a clinical trial usually means that some adjustments of the observed p-values for multiplicity of tests may be required for the control of the type I error rate. In this paper, we discuss statistical concerns associated with some commonly used multiple endpoint adjustment procedures. We also present limited Monte Carlo simulation results to demonstrate the performance of selected p-value-based methods in protecting the type I error rate.},

abstract = {A feature increasingly utilized in clinical trial practice is to allow a study to stop early when it seems unlikely to achieve its primary efficacy objectives. This is commonly referred to as stopping for futility, and can be motivated by ethical and financial considerations. A number of methods for addressing futility have been described in the literature, including rules based upon conditional power, predictive probability, beta spending functions, and others. We consider futility stopping from the point of view of quantifying and providing an objective sensible balance between risks of incorrect decisions (e.g., stopping trials which should continue, and continuing trials which should stop), and discuss how specific considerations within a trial can lead to choice of a sensible scheme. This approach is not specific to any particular scales in the literature such as those just mentioned, and we describe interrelationships among criteria expressed on different scales. As futility may be evaluated multiple times in a long-term trial and the amount of information available at scheduled interim analyses may be difficult to predict in advance, we present a specific optimality criterion and discuss which of the familiar scales tend to produce schemes simple to describe and implement, and with better behavior across different timepoints at which futility might be evaluated.},

abstract = {In the last decade, new therapeutic approaches targeting $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) have been discovered and developed with the hope of modifying the natural history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The most revolutionary of these approaches consists in the removal of brain A$\beta$ via anti-A$\beta$ antibodies. After an active vaccine (AN1792) was discontinued in 2002 due to occurrence of meningoencephalitis in approximately 6{\%} of patients, several other second-generation active A$\beta$ vaccines and passive A$\beta$ immunotherapies have been developed and are under clinical investigation with the aim of accelerating A$\beta$ clearance from the brain of AD patients. The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, which is composed of humanized anti-A$\beta$ monoclonal antibodies that has been tested in two Phase II trials. Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce A$\beta$ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE $\epsilon$4 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its clinical use. The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab will provide answers regarding whether passive anti-A$\beta$ immunization is able to alter the course of this devastating disease.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved. Background: Available therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) can only alleviate and delay the advance of symptoms, with the greatest impact eventually achieved when provided at an early stage. Thus, early identification of which subjects at high risk, e.g., with MCI, will later develop AD is of key importance. Currently available machine learning algorithms achieve only limited predictive accuracy or they are based on expensive and hard-to-collect information. Objective: The current study aims to develop an algorithm for a 3-year prediction of conversion to AD in MCI and PreMCI subjects based only on non-invasively and effectively collectable predictors. Methods: A dataset of 123 MCI/PreMCI subjects was used to train different machine learning techniques. Baseline information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and neuropsychological test scores, cardiovascular risk indexes, and a visual rating scale for brain atrophy was used to extract 36 predictors. Leave-pair-out-cross-validation was employed as validation strategy and a recursive feature elimination procedure was applied to identify a relevant subset of predictors. Results: 16 predictors were selected from all domains excluding sociodemographic information. The best model resulted a support vector machine with radial-basis function kernel (whole sample: AUC= 0.962, best balanced accuracy = 0.913; MCI sub-group alone: AUC= 0.914, best balanced accuracy = 0.874). Conclusions: Our algorithm shows very high cross-validated performances that outperform the vast majority of the currently available algorithms, and all those which use only non-invasive and effectively assessable predictors. Further testing and optimization in independent samples will warrant its application in both clinical practice and clinical trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research evidence from observational studies suggests that cognitive activity reduces the risk of cognitive impairment in later life as well as the rate of cognitive decline of people with dementia. The Promoting Healthy Ageing with Cognitive Exercise (PACE) study has been designed to determine whether a cognitive activity intervention decreases the rate of cognitive decline amongst older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

METHODS/DESIGN: The study will recruit 160 community-dwelling men and women aged 65 years of age or over with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Participants will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups: non-specific education and cognitive activity. The intervention will consist of ten 90-minute sessions delivered twice per week over a period of five weeks. The primary outcome measure of the study is the change from baseline in the total score on the Cambridge Cognitive Score (CAMCOG). Secondary outcomes of interest include changes in memory, attention, executive functions, mood and quality of life. Primary endpoints will be collected 12, 52 and 104 weeks after the baseline assessment.

DISCUSSION: The proposed project will produce the best available evidence on the merits of increased cognitive activity as a strategy to prevent cognitive decline among older adults with MCI. We anticipate that the results of this study will have implications for the development of evidence-based preventive strategies to reduce the rate of cognitive decline amongst older people at risk of dementia.

@article{Durkalski2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical trial investigators and sponsors invest vast amounts of resources and energy into conducting trials and often face daily challenges with data management, project management, and data quality control. Rather than waiting months for study progress reports, investigators need the ability to use real-time data for the coordination and management of study activities across all study team members including site investigators, oversight committees, data and safety monitoring boards, and medical safety monitors. Web-based data management systems are beginning to meet this need but what distinguishes one system from the other are user needs/requirements and cost.

PURPOSE: To illustrate the development and implementation of a web-based data and project management system for a multicenter clinical trial designed to test the superiority of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation versus sham for the treatment of patients with major depression.

METHODS: The authors discuss the reasons for not using a commercially available system for this study and describe the approach to developing their own web-based system for the OPT-TMS study. Timelines, effort, system architecture, and lessons learned are shared with the hope that this information will direct clinical trial researchers and software developers towards more efficient, user-friendly systems.

RESULTS: The developers use a combination of generic and custom application code to allow for the flexibility to adapt the system to the needs of the study. Features of the system include: central participant registration and randomization; secure data entry at the site; participant progress/study calendar; safety data reporting; device accounting; monitor verification; and user-configurable generic reports and built-in customized reports.

LIMITATIONS: Hard coding was more time-efficient to address project-specific issues compared with the effort of creating a generic code application. As a consequence of this strategy, the required maintenance of the system is increased and the value of using this system for other trials is reduced.

CONCLUSION: Web-based central computerized systems offer time-saving, secure options for managing clinical trial data. The choice of a commercially available system or an internally developed system is determined by the requirements of the study and users. Pros and cons to both approaches were discussed. If the intention is to use the system for various trials (single and multi-center, phases I-III) across various therapeutic areas, then the overall design should be a generic structure that simplifies the general application with minimal loss of functionality.},

Traditional methods rely on approximations based on asymptotic results which are very powerful but not always appropriate. In this article we show that efficient rerandomization methods may be developed for many commonly used models and tests: multinomial testing, specifically goodness-of-fit and max tests; and goodness-of-fit of log-linear models for contingency tables. The feasibility (complexity) of these algorithms is a function of the sufficient statistics for the models. By contrast, algorithms which require the explicit enumeration of all outcomes in the sample space are exponential in the degrees of freedom, and are usually not feasible except when sample sizes are unrealistically small. The algorithms we present are different from recently proposed methods since we show how to calculate permutation distributions of commonly used statistics rather than calculating p-values for exact tests, and we emphasize underlying probability formulas rather than implementation details. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Jones2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, are the drug class with the best evidence of efficacy, licensed for mild to moderate AD, while the glutamate antagonist memantine has been widely prescribed, often in the later stages of AD. Memantine is licensed for moderate to severe dementia in AD but is not recommended by the England and Wales National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. However, there is little evidence to guide clinicians as to what to prescribe as AD advances; in particular, what to do as the condition progresses from moderate to severe. Options include continuing cholinesterase inhibitors irrespective of decline, adding memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors, or prescribing memantine instead of cholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this trial is to establish the most effective drug option for people with AD who are progressing from moderate to severe dementia despite treatment with donepezil.

METHOD: DOMINO-AD is a pragmatic, 15 centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial. Patients with AD, currently living at home, receiving donepezil 10 mg daily, and with Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) scores between 5 and 13 are being recruited. Each is randomized to one of four treatment options: continuation of donepezil with memantine placebo added; switch to memantine with donepezil placebo added; donepezil and memantine together; or donepezil placebo with memantine placebo. 800 participants are being recruited and treatment continues for one year. Primary outcome measures are cognition (SMMSE) and activities of daily living (Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale). Secondary outcomes are non-cognitive dementia symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), health related quality of life (EQ-5D and DEMQOL-proxy), carer burden (General Health Questionnaire-12), cost effectiveness (using Client Service Receipt Inventory) and institutionalization. These outcomes are assessed at baseline, 6, 18, 30 and 52 weeks. All participants will be subsequently followed for 3 years by telephone interview to record institutionalization.

DISCUSSION: There is considerable debate about the clinical and cost effectiveness of anti-dementia drugs. DOMINO-AD seeks to provide clear evidence on the best treatment strategies for those managing patients at a particularly important clinical transition point.

abstract = {Background: Bapineuzumab is a humanized anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody that recognizes amino acids 1-5 of the human Abeta1-42 peptide and has been shown to reduce cerebral Abeta. The bapineuzumab phase 3 development program consisted of four clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenously (IV) administered bapineuzumab compared to placebo over 18 months of treatment in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). This abstract summarizes the results of two trials, Pfizer studies 3000 (in subjects who are apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 non-carriers) and 3001 (in ApoE4-carriers), which were terminated by the Sponsor in August 2012 due to the lack of clinical efficacy observed in completed studies ELN115727-301 (ApoE4 non-carriers) and ELN115727-302 (ApoE4 carriers) (Salloway, 2013 submitted). Methods: Eligible AD subjects (MMSE 16-26) were randomized to receive bapineuzumab (0.5 mg/kg in study 3001; 0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg in study 3000) or placebo in a 3:2 bapineuzmab: placebo ratio. Subjects received a total of 6 intravenous infusions every 13 weeks with a planned total follow up of 78 weeks. The co-primary clinical endpoints were change from baseline to week 78 on the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale(ADAS-Cog/11) and the Disability assessment for Dementia (DAD). Biomarker endpoints included PiBPET brain amyloid burden, cerebrospinal fluid phospho-tau (CSF ptau), and brain volume assessed by brain boundary shift integral (BBSI). Statistical analyses were performed to estimate treatment differences at study endpoint through mixed models for repeated measures and analysis of covariance. Safety was performed by assessing the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and clinically important changes in safety assessment results. Results: A total of 1,978 subjects were randomized and dosed (885 subjects in study 3000, which was terminated before enrollment was completed and 1093 subjects in study 3001 for which enrollment had already completed at the time of termination). Overall, 320 subjects (36{\%}) completed study 3000 and 683 (62.1{\%}) subjects completed study 3001.No statistically significant differences were seen between any bapineuzumab dose group and placebo on either of the co-primary efficacy endpoints at Week 78 in either study (1.0mg/kg: p=0.848 for the ADAS-Cog/11 total score, p=0.623 for the DAD total score; 0.5 mg/kg: p=0.057 for the ADAS-Cog/11 total score, p=0.459 for the DAD total score in study 3000; 0.5 mg/kg: p=0.979 for the ADAS-Cog/11 total score; p=0.973 for the DAD total score in study 3001). Results for PIB PET and CSF p-tau, although numerically favoring bapineuzumab, were not statistically significant. The impact of study termination and the resulting small sample size of these substudies make the interpretation of the data difficult (PiB Pet: N=30 in study 3000, N=56 in study 3001; CSF p-tau: N=76 in study 3000, N=138 in study 3001). The sample size for the MRI substudy was larger [N=396 in study 3000, N=540 in study 3001], however, therewere no statistically significant differences between bapineuzumab and placebo-treated groups on BBSi in either study. Safety data from studies 3000 and 3001 did not reveal any new safety signals and the findings were consistent with those observed in studies 301 and 302. In particular, the incidence proportion of vasogenic edema (VE) in the bapineuzumab 0.5 mg/kg group (4.9{\%} in study 3000; 16.8{\%} in study 3001) or 1.0 mg/kg group (11.8{\%} in study 3000) was generally consistent with observations in studies 301 and 302. Conclusion: Studies 3000 and 3001 demonstrated no significant changes on cognitive or functional measures in the bapineuzumab-treated groups compared to placebo. No significant treatment differences were seen on biomarkers, although sample size and follow-up time were both limited for the CSF and Pet sub-studies. The safety profile of bapineuzumab was consistent with that of previously reported trials.},

abstract = {In many longitudinal studies, evaluating the effect of a binary or continuous predictor variable on the rate of change of the outcome, i.e. slope, is often of primary interest. Sample size determination of these studies, however, is complicated by the expectation that missing data will occur due to missed visits, early drop out, and staggered entry. Despite the availability of methods for assessing power in longitudinal studies with missing data, the impact on power of the magnitude and distribution of missing data in the study population remain poorly understood. As a result, simple but erroneous alterations of the sample size formulae for complete/balanced data are commonly applied. These ‘naive' approaches include the average sum of squares and average number of subjects methods. The goal of this article is to explore in greater detail the effect of missing data on study power and compare the performance of naive sample size methods to a correct maximum likelihood-based method using both mathematical and simulation-based approaches. Two different longitudinal aging studies are used to illustrate the methods.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the relationship between the 2 hallmark proteins of Alzheimer disease (AD), amyloid-(A$\beta$) and tau, and clinical decline over time among cognitively normal older individuals.

DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort of clinically and cognitively normal older individuals assessed with baseline lumbar puncture and longitudinal clinical assessments.

SETTING: Research centers across the United States and Canada.

PATIENTS: We examined 107 participants with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 at baseline examination.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using linear mixed effects models, we investigated the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau 181 (p-tau(181p)),CSF A$\beta$(1-42), and clinical decline as assessed using longitudinal change in global CDR, CDR-Sum of Boxes, and the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale.

RESULTS: We found a significant relationship between decreased CSF A$\beta$(1-42) and longitudinal change in global CDR,CDR-Sum of Boxes, and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale in individuals with elevated CSFp-tau(181p). In the absence of CSF p-tau(181p), the effect of CSF A$\beta$(1-42) on longitudinal clinical decline was not significantly different from 0.

CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively normal older individuals,A-associated clinical decline during a mean of 3 years may occur only in the presence of ongoing downstream neurodegeneration.},

@article{Davidian2005,
abstract = {The pretest-posttest study is commonplace in numerous applications. Typically, subjects are randomized to two treatments, and response is measured at baseline, prior to intervention with the randomized treatment (pretest), and at prespecified follow-up time (posttest). Interest focuses on the effect of treatments on the change between mean baseline and follow-up response. Missing posttest response for some subjects is routine, and disregarding missing cases can lead to invalid inference. Despite the popularity of this design, a consensus on an appropriate analysis when no data are missing, let alone for taking into account missing follow-up, does not exist. Under a semiparametric perspective on the pretest-posttest model, in which limited distributional assumptions on pretest or posttest response are made, we show how the theory of Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao may be used to characterize a class of consistent treatment effect estimators and to identify the efficient estimator in the class. We then describe how the theoretical results translate into practice. The development not only shows how a unified framework for inference in this setting emerges from the Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao theory, but also provides a review and demonstration of the key aspects of this theory in a familiar context. The results are also relevant to the problem of comparing two treatment means with adjustment for baseline covariates. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2005.},

abstract = {Importance Among cognitively normal individuals, elevated brain amyloid (defined by cerebrospinal fluid assays or positron emission tomography regional summaries) can be related to risk for later Alzheimer-related cognitive decline. Objective To characterize and quantify the risk for Alzheimer-related cognitive decline among cognitively normal individuals with elevated brain amyloid. Design, Setting, and Participants Exploratory analyses were conducted with longitudinal cognitive and biomarker data from 445 cognitively normal individuals in the United States and Canada. Participants were observed from August 23, 2005, to June 7, 2016, for a median of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 2.0-4.2 years; maximum follow-up, 10.3 years) as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Exposures Individuals were classified at baseline as having normal (n = 243) or elevated (n = 202) brain amyloid using positron emission tomography amyloid imaging or a cerebrospinal fluid assay of amyloid $\beta$. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included scores on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC; a sum of 4 baseline standardized z scores, which decreases with worse performance), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 0 [worst] to 30 [best] points), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum of Boxes; 0 [best] to 18 [worst] points), and Logical Memory Delayed Recall (0 [worst] to 25 [best] story units). Results Among the 445 participants (243 with normal amyloid, 202 with elevated amyloid), mean (SD) age was 74.0 (5.9) years, mean education was 16.4 (2.7) years, and 52{\%} were women. The mean score for PACC at baseline was 0.00 (2.60); for MMSE, 29.0 (1.2); for CDR-Sum of Boxes, 0.04 (0.14); and for Logical Memory Delayed Recall, 13.1 (3.3). Compared with the group with normal amyloid, those with elevated amyloid had worse mean scores at 4 years on the PACC (mean difference, 1.51 points [95{\%} CI, 0.94-2.10]; P {\textless} .001), MMSE (mean difference, 0.56 points [95{\%} CI, 0.32-0.80]; P {\textless} .001), and CDR-Sum of Boxes (mean difference, 0.23 points [95{\%} CI, 0.08-0.38]; P = .002). For Logical Memory Delayed Recall, between-group score was not statistically significant at 4 years (mean difference, 0.73 story units [95{\%} CI, -0.02 to 1.48]; P = .056). Conclusions and Relevance Exploratory analyses of a cognitively normal cohort followed up for a median of 3.1 years suggest that elevation in baseline brain amyloid level, compared with normal brain amyloid level, was associated with higher likelihood of cognitive decline, although the findings are of uncertain clinical significance. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of these differences and measure longer-term associations.},

abstract = {When testing for stochastic order in ordered 2 x J contingency tables, it is common to select the cutoff required to declare significance so as to ensure that the size of the test is exactly alpha conditionally on the margins. It is valid, however, to use the margins to select not only the cutoff but also the form of the test. Linear rank tests, which are locally most powerful and frequently used in practice, suffer from the drawback that they may have power as low as zero to detect some alternatives of interest when the margins satisfy certain conditions. The Smirnov and convex hull tests are shown, through exact conditional power calculations and simulations, to avoid this drawback. The convex hull test is also admissible and palindromic invariant and minimizes the required significance level to have limiting power of one as the alternative moves away from the null in any direction.},

abstract = {Accumulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) within the rat hippocampus following septal denervation is thought to contribute to sympathetic axon ingrowth. However, intraventricular NGF infusion, which results in elevated hippocampal NGF, fails to elicit such sprouting, although it increases innervation of the extracerebral vasculature. To determine whether or not NGF would stimulate sympathohippocampal sprouting, we infused NGF after sprouting was initiated. Surprisingly, NGF reduced the amount of hippocampal sprouting and, when infused at the time of lesion, delayed its onset while, at the same time, stimulating perivascular sprouting. Since NGF did not prevent ingrowth into the hippocampus from transplanted sympathetic ganglia, the reduction in sympathetic hippocampal fibers from intact ganglia appears to result from the proliferation of vascular fibers. Thus, changes in trophic support (NGF levels) appear to be sufficient to produce remodeling of mature, uninjured sympathetic arbors. Such trophomorphism may underlie collateral elimination during normal development and injury-induced neuronal rearrangements.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Age-associated changes in brain imaging and fluid biomarkers are characterized and compared in presenilin 1 (PSEN1)E280A mutation carriers and noncarriers from the world's largest known autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) kindred.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To characterize and compare age-associated changes in brain imaging and fluid biomarkers in PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers and noncarriers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional measures of 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography, 18F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, structural magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma biomarkers of AD were assessed from 54 PSEN1 E280A kindred members (age range, 20-59 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used brain mapping algorithms to compare regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose and gray matter volumes in cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers and noncarriers. We used regression analyses to characterize associations between age and the mean cortical to pontine 18F-florbetapir standard uptake value ratios, precuneus cerebral metabolic rates for glucose, hippocampal gray matter volume, CSF A$\beta$1-42, total tau and phosphorylated tau181, and plasma A$\beta$ measurements. Age at onset of progressive biomarker changes that distinguish carriers from noncarriers was estimated using best-fitting regression models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Compared with noncarriers, cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers had significantly lower precuneus cerebral metabolic rates for glucose, smaller hippocampal volume, lower CSF A$\beta$1-42, higher CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau181, and higher plasma A$\beta$1-42 measurements. Sequential changes in biomarkers were seen at age 20 years (95{\%} CI, 14-24 years) for CSF A$\beta$1-42, age 16 years (95{\%} CI, 11-24 years) for the mean cortical 18F-florbetapir standard uptake value ratio, age 15 years (95{\%} CI, 10-24 years) for precuneus cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, age 15 years (95{\%} CI, 7-20 years) for CSF total tau, age 13 years (95{\%} CI, 8-19 years) for phosphorylated tau181, and age 6 years (95{\%} CI, 1-10 years) for hippocampal volume, with cognitive decline up to 6 years before the kindred's estimated median age of 44 years (95{\%} CI, 43-45 years) at mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. No age-associated findings were seen in plasma A$\beta$1-42 or A$\beta$1-40.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study provides additional information about the course of different AD biomarkers in the preclinical and clinical stages of autosomal dominant AD.},

abstract = {AIMS: The efficacy of treatments for osteoporosis can be evaluated using a variety of study designs. This article aims to comprehensively review the evidence for bisphosphonate anti-fracture efficacy in postmenopausal women, discussing the strengths and limitations associated with each study method.

METHODS: Literature analysis included English-language publications reporting results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), post hoc analyses, meta analyses and observational studies evaluating the efficacy of alendronate (ALN), ibandronate (IBN), risedronate (RIS) and zoledronate (ZOL), with an initial sample size {\textgreater} or = 100 patients, and follow-up data for at least 1 year.

RESULTS: Primary and secondary analyses of RCT data suggest differences among bisphosphonates with regard to site-specific anti-fracture efficacy and onset of fracture risk reduction. While some observational studies indicate differences in clinical outcomes among these agents, others report similar effectiveness. ALN and RIS data demonstrate sustained fracture protection for up to 10 and 7 years of treatment respectively. The efficacy of IBN and ZOL has been evaluated for up to 3 and 5 years respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Understanding of the benefits of bisphosphonate treatment can be maximised by evaluating complementary data from RCTs and observational database studies. Fracture risk reduction with bisphosphonates is shown in RCTs and in real-world clinical settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dopaminergic neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease leads to changes in the circuitry of the basal ganglia, such as decreased inhibitory GABAergic input to the subthalamic nucleus. We aimed to measure the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of transfer of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) gene with adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease.

METHODS: We did an open label, safety and tolerability trial of unilateral subthalamic viral vector (AAV-GAD) injection in 11 men and 1 woman with Parkinson's disease (mean age 58.2, SD=5.7 years). Four patients received low-dose, four medium-dose, and four high-dose AAV-GAD at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Inclusion criteria consisted of Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 or greater, motor fluctuations with substantial off time, and age 70 years or less. Patients were assessed clinically both off and on medication at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months at North Shore Hospital. Efficacy measures included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), scales of activities of daily living (ADL), neuropsychological testing, and PET imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. The trial is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov registry, number NCT00195143.

FINDINGS: All patients who enrolled had surgery, and there were no dropouts or patients lost to follow-up. There were no adverse events related to gene therapy. Significant improvements in motor UPDRS scores (p=0.0015), predominantly on the side of the body that was contralateral to surgery, were seen 3 months after gene therapy and persisted up to 12 months. PET scans revealed a substantial reduction in thalamic metabolism that was restricted to the treated hemisphere, and a correlation between clinical motor scores and brain metabolism in the supplementary motor area.

INTERPRETATION: AAV-GAD gene therapy of the subthalamic nucleus is safe and well tolerated by patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, suggesting that in-vivo gene therapy in the adult brain might be safe for various neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Several possible methods used to evaluate treatment effects in a randomized pretest-posttest trial with two treatment groups are the two-sample t test, the paired t test, analysis of covariance I (ANCOVA I), the analysis of covariance II (ANCOVA II), and generalized estimating equations (GEE). The ANCOVA I includes treatment and baseline response as covariates in a linear model and ANCOVA II additionally includes an interaction term between the baseline response and treatment indicator as a covariate. The parameters in the ANCOVA I and ANCOVA II models are generally estimated using ordinary least squares. In this article, a semiparametric model, which makes no assumptions about the response distributions, is used. The asymptotic properties of the estimators derived from these five methods and their relative efficiencies are discussed under this semiparametric model. We show that all these methods yield consistent estimators for the treatment effect which have asymptotically normal distributions under the semiparametric model. The GEE and the ANCOVA II estimators are asymptotically equivalent and the most efficient. The estimators from other three methods are less efficient except under some special conditions which are outlined in the article.},

abstract = {The objectives of the study were to determine whether retrospective data can be used to answer questions about the efficacy of prokinetic agents when used to treat horses with post-operative ileus (POI). We describe prevalence and mortality of POI with reference to treatment with four prokinetic agents. By combining data from two Hospitals a study population of 55 horses with POI following pedunculated lipoma obstruction (PLO) was established. Univariable and multivariable associations were determined between short term survival and potential explanatory variables. With death as outcome in multivariable models, breed and hospital were significantly associated with outcome but the use of prokinetic agents was not (P=0.15). However, sample size estimates indicate the low power of this study to detect differences in outcome. It was not possible definitively to evaluate the efficacy of prokinetics as treatment for POI following PLO using retrospective data. The data were suggestive of limited efficacy of prokinetics as treatment for POI. It is postulated that the identified association between hospital and survival reflects differences in clinician decision making. The study highlights the need for further prospective studies using randomised clinical trials to evaluate accurately the efficacy of prokinetic agents. This report illustrates difficulties with performing retrospective analysis of clinical data to determine the efficacy of treatment regimes.},

Methods: Longitudinal analysis of covariance, repeated measures analysis in which also the baseline value is used as outcome and the analysis of changes were theoretically explained and applied to an example dataset investigating a systolic blood pressure lowering treatment. Results: It was shown that differences at baseline should be taken into account and that regular repeated measures analysis and regular analysis of changes did not adjust for the baseline differences between the groups and therefore lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect. In the real life example, due to the differences at baseline between the treatment and control group, the different methods lead to different estimates of the treatment effect. Conclusion: Regarding the analysis of RCT data, it is advised to use longitudinal analysis of covariance or a repeated measures analysis without the treatment variable, but with the interaction between treatment and time in the model.},

We illustrate its use in the two-sample setting using the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic, but the algorithm accommodates the entire class of linear rank statistics and can be extended to include nonlinear rank statistics as well. The sample size determinations can be based on either exact power or on a very precise Monte Carlo estimate of it. To reduce the computations further, power can be computed as a function of asymptotic critical values when the number of categories is not too small. For the Wilcoxon statistic we show that this approximation works well if there are more than five response categories.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether antioxidant supplements presumed to target specific cellular compartments affected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.

DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

SETTING: Academic medical centers.

PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

INTERVENTION: Random assignment to treatment for 16 weeks with 800 IU/d of vitamin E ($\alpha$-tocopherol) plus 500 mg/d of vitamin C plus 900 mg/d of $\alpha$-lipoic acid (E/C/ALA); 400 mg of coenzyme Q 3 times/d; or placebo.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes from baseline to 16 weeks in CSF biomarkers related to Alzheimer disease and oxidative stress, cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), and function (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Scale).

RESULTS: Seventy-eight subjects were randomized; 66 provided serial CSF specimens adequate for biochemical analyses. Study drugs were well tolerated, but accelerated decline in Mini-Mental State Examination scores occurred in the E/C/ALA group, a potential safety concern. Changes in CSF A$\beta$42, tau, and P-tau(181) levels did not differ between the 3 groups. Cerebrospinal fluid F2-isoprostane levels, an oxidative stress biomarker, decreased on average by 19{\%} from baseline to week 16 in the E/C/ALA group but were unchanged in the other groups.

CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidants did not influence CSF biomarkers related to amyloid or tau pathology. Lowering of CSF F2-isoprostane levels in the E/C/ALA group suggests reduction of oxidative stress in the brain. However, this treatment raised the caution of faster cognitive decline, which would need careful assessment if longer-term clinical trials are conducted.

We will learn more about the natural history of the disease and any partial therapeutic responses from detailed analyses of recent trial results.

abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) measures abilities broadly related to executive function (EF), including WAIS-R Digit Symbol Substitution, Digit Span Backwards, Trails A and B, Category Fluency, and Clock Drawing. This study investigates whether a composite executive function measure based on these multiple indicators has better psychometric characteristics than the widely used individual components. We applied item response theory methods to 800 ADNI participants to derive an EF composite score (ADNI-EF) from the above measures. We then compared ADNI-EF with component measures in 390 longitudinally-followed participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with respect to: (1) Ability to detect change over time; (2) Ability to predict conversion to dementia; (3) Strength of cross-sectional association with MRI-derived measures of structures involved in frontal systems, and (4) Strength of baseline association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid $\beta$₁₋₄₂, total tau, and phosphorylated tau(181P). ADNI-EF showed the greatest change over time, followed closely by Category Fluency. ADNI-EF needed a 40 {\%} smaller sample size to detect change. ADNI-EF was the strongest predictor of AD conversion. ADNI-EF was the only measure significantly associated with all the MRI regions, though other measures were more strongly associated in a few of the regions. ADNI-EF was associated with all the CSF measures. ADNI-EF appears to be a useful composite measure of EF in MCI, as good as or better than any of its composite parts. This study demonstrates an approach to developing a psychometrically sophisticated composite score from commonly-used tests.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials use composite end points to reduce sample size, but the relative importance of each individual end point within the composite may differ between patients and researchers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We asked 785 cardiovascular patients and 164 clinical trial authors to assign 25 "spending weights" across 5 common adverse events comprising composite end points in cardiovascular trials: death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for angina. We then calculated end point ratios for each participant's ratings of each nonfatal end point relative to death. Whereas patients assigned an average weight of 5 to death, equal or greater weight was assigned to myocardial infarction (mean ratio, 1.12) and stroke (ratio, 1.08). In contrast, clinical trialists were much more concerned about death (average weight, 8) than myocardial infarction (ratio, 0.63) or stroke (ratio, 0.53). Both patients and trialists considered revascularization (ratio, 0.48 and 0.20, respectively) and hospitalization (ratio, 0.28 and 0.13, respectively) as substantially less severe than death. Differences between patient and trialist end point weights persisted after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics (P{\textless}0.001 for all comparisons).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Patients and clinical trialists did not weigh individual components of a composite end point equally. Whereas trialists are most concerned about avoiding death, patients place equal or greater importance on reducing myocardial infarction or stroke. Both groups considered revascularization and hospitalization as substantially less severe. These findings suggest that equal weights in a composite clinical end point do not accurately reflect the preferences of either patients or trialists.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) is a commonly used measure for assessing cognitive dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The measure has 11 subscales, each of which captures an important aspect of cognitive dysfunction in AD. Traditional scoring of the ADAS-cog involves adding up the scores from the subscales without regarding their varying difficulty or their strength of relationship to AD-associated cognitive dysfunction. The present article analyzes problems associated with this approach and offers solutions for gaining measurement precision by modeling how the subscales function. 

METHODS
We analyzed data collected at the Baylor College of Medicine Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders Clinic from 1240 patients diagnosed with varying degrees of dementia. Item response theory was used to determine the relationship between total scores on the ADAS-cog and the underlying level of cognitive dysfunction reflected by the scores. 

RESULTS
Results revealed that each total score corresponded to a spectrum of cognitive dysfunction, indicating that total scores were relatively imprecise indicators of underlying cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, it was common for two individuals with the same total score to have significantly different degrees of cognitive dysfunction. 

CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that item response theory scoring of the ADAS-cog may measure cognitive dysfunction more precisely than a total score method.},

abstract = {Permutation tests are amongst the most commonly used statistical tools in modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly, understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to assign p-values. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context. The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of permutation tests in practice.},

We show that this chi2 test can have inflated type I error rates, even in relatively large samples (e.g., samples of 1,000 individuals that include approximately 100 copies of the minor allele). On the basis of previous work, we describe exact tests of HWE together with efficient computational methods for their implementation. Our methods adequately control type I error in large and small samples and are computationally efficient. They have been implemented in freely available code that will be useful for quality assessment of genotype data and for the detection of genetic association or population stratification in very large data sets.},

abstract = {The assessment and prediction of a subject's current and future risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease are of great interest in both the design of clinical trials as well as in clinical decision making. Exploring the longitudinal trajectory of markers related to neurodegeneration is an important task when selecting subjects for treatment in trials and the clinic, in the evaluation of early disease indicators and the monitoring of disease progression. Given that there is substantial intersubject variability, models that attempt to describe marker trajectories for a whole population will likely lack specificity for the representation of individual patients. Therefore, we argue here that individualized models provide a more accurate alternative that can be used for tasks such as population stratification and a subject-specific prognosis. In the work presented here, mixed effects modeling is used to derive global and individual marker trajectories for a training population. Test subject (new patient) specific models are then instantiated using a stratified “marker signature” that defines a subpopulation of similar cases within the training database. From this subpopulation, personalized models of the expected trajectory of several markers are subsequently estimated for unseen patients. These patient specific models of markers are shown to provide better predictions of time-to-conversion to Alzheimer's disease than population based models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has broadened into early interventions in individuals with modest cognitive impairment and a slow decline. The 11-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) was originally developed to measure cognition in patients with mild to moderate AD. Attempts to improve its properties for early AD by removing items prone to ceiling and/or by adding cognitive measures known to be impaired early have yielded a number of ADAS-Cog variants. Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data, we compared the performance of the 3-, 5-, 11- and 13-item ADAS-Cog variants in subjects with early AD. Given the interest in enrichment strategies, we also examined this aspect with a focus on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. METHODS: Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD with available ADAS-Cog 13 and CSF data were analysed. The decline over time was defined by change from baseline. Direct cross-comparison of the ADAS-Cog variants was performed using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with higher values reflecting increased sensitivity to detect change over time. RESULTS: The decline over time on any of the ADAS-Cog variants was minimal in subjects with MCI. Approximately half of subjects with MCI fulfilled enrichment criteria for positive AD pathology. The impact of enrichment was detectable but subtle in MCI. The annual decline in mild AD was more pronounced but still modest. More than 90 {\%} of subjects with mild AD had positive AD pathology. SNRs were low in MCI but greater in mild AD. The numerically largest SNRs were seen for the ADAS-Cog 5 in MCI and for both the 5- and 13-item ADAS-Cog variants in mild AD, although associated confidence intervals were large. CONCLUSIONS: The possible value of ADAS-Cog expansion or reduction is less than compelling, particularly in MCI. In mild AD, adding items known to be impaired at early stages seems to provide more benefit than removing items on which subjects score close to ceiling.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.Repeated confidence intervals (RCIs) and prediction intervals (PIs) can be used for the design and monitoring of group sequential trials. Stochastically curtailed tests (SCTs) under fractional Brownian motion (FBM) have been studied for the interim analysis of clinical trials (Zhang et al., 2015). In this article, we derive RCIs and PIs based on SCTs under FBM for one-sided derived tests (Jennison and Turnbull, 2000). Comparisons of RCI width and sample size requirement are made to those under Brownian motion (BM) and to those of Pocock and O'Brien-Fleming design types for various type I, type II error rates, and number of interim analyses. Interim data from Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial are used to illustrate how to design and monitor clinical trials using these RCIs and PIs under FBM. Results show that these one-sided derived tests based on SCTs have narrower final confidence intervals and require smaller sample sizes than those using classical group sequential designs. The Hurst parameter has more impact on the RCI width than on the sample size requirements for the proposed designs.},

abstract = {Several years after the intriguing novelty in the $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) cascade hypothesis, where the A$\beta$ oligomers emerged as the most detrimental species in the neuropathogenic process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in place of fibrillar plaques, more recently innate immune system have come on stage as the other prominent factor. Neuroinflammation apparently contributes to AD eziopathogenesis, in large part through overactivation of microglia cells.Genetic and experimental studies strongly support the contribution of the immune system to increasing the risk of AD and participating in its progression. Besides the central immune response mediated by resident microglial cells, peripheral immune challenges may have profound negative effects on brain physiology as well, such as those originating from the gut microbiota.Despite the initial immune response to defend the organism, perpetuation seemingly turns into a chronic detrimental phenomenon that contributes to neuronal dysfunction and exacerbation of the disease. Several new immune-druggable targets are now under investigation, but much still remains to be defined about their precise role and whether and how their physiological activity changes in the injurious context of AD. From a therapeutic perspective, we can undoubtedly consider that AD is no longer solely an A$\beta$ pathology, but rather a multifaceted disorder calling for multi-target therapies. New therapies fighting AD must still counteract A$\beta$ but must also restore appropriate immune defences by tempering maladaptive factors and enabling beneficial responses.},

abstract = {REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a web-based software solution and tool set that allows biomedical researchers to create secure online forms for data capture, management and analysis with minimal effort and training. The Shared Data Instrument Library (SDIL) is a relatively new component of REDCap that allows sharing of commonly used data collection instruments for immediate study use by research teams. Objectives of the SDIL project include: (1) facilitating reuse of data dictionaries and reducing duplication of effort; (2) promoting the use of validated data collection instruments, data standards and best practices; and (3) promoting research collaboration and data sharing. Instruments submitted to the library are reviewed by a library oversight committee, with rotating membership from multiple institutions, which ensures quality, relevance and legality of shared instruments. The design allows researchers to download the instruments in a consumable electronic format in the REDCap environment. At the time of this writing, the SDIL contains over 128 data collection instruments. Over 2500 instances of instruments have been downloaded by researchers at multiple institutions. In this paper we describe the library platform, provide detail about experience gained during the first 25. months of sharing public domain instruments and provide evidence of impact for the SDIL across the REDCap consortium research community. We postulate that the shared library of instruments reduces the burden of adhering to sound data collection principles while promoting best practices. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Interventions that either modify risk or reduce the development of early disease could delay the onset of dementia or reduce the rate of cognitive and functional decline. The European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) is a public-private consortium, funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, designed to increase the likelihood of successful development of new treatments for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer's dementia. EPAD will help with testing of different agents in this pre-dementia population through four components: improvement of access to existing cohorts and registries, development of the EPAD Registry of approximately 24 000 people who might be at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia, establishment of the EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study of 6000 people at any one time, and establishment of an adaptive, proof-of-concept trial including 1500 participants at any given time. The need for EPAD and its key design elements are described, and we discuss EPAD in relation to similar projects in progress. These parallel efforts reflect the need for a coordinated, worldwide battle against dementia, in which EPAD will play a crucial role.},

Here we delivered GDNF directly into the putamen of five Parkinson patients in a phase 1 safety trial. One catheter needed to be repositioned and there were changes in the magnetic resonance images that disappeared after lowering the concentration of GDNF. After one year, there were no serious clinical side effects, a 39{\%} improvement in the off-medication motor sub-score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and a 61{\%} improvement in the activities of daily living sub-score. Medication-induced dyskinesias were reduced by 64{\%} and were not observed off medication during chronic GDNF delivery. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans of [(18)F]dopamine uptake showed a significant 28{\%} increase in putamen dopamine storage after 18 months, suggesting a direct effect of GDNF on dopamine function. This study warrants careful examination of GDNF as a treatment for Parkinson disease.},

We compare the power to detect a treatment effect using either rate of change, as estimated by linear models of longitudinal continuous data, or time-to-event estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. We propose an analytic inflation factor for comparing the two types of analyses assuming that the time-to-event can be expressed as a time-to-threshold of the continuous measure. We conduct simulations based on a publicly available Alzheimer's disease data set in which the time-to-event is algorithmically defined based on a battery of assessments. A Cox proportional hazards model of the time-to-event endpoint is compared to a linear model of a single assessment from the battery. The simulations also explore the impact of baseline covariates in either analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The use of mixed effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) for clinical trial analyses has recently gained broad support as a primary analysis methodology. Some questions of practical implementation detail remain, however. For example, whether and how to incorporate clinical trial data that is collected at nonprotocol-specified timepoints or clinic visits has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we compare different methods for applying MMRM to trials wherein data is available at protocol-specified timepoints, as well as nonprotocol-specified timepoints due to patient early discontinuation. The methods under consideration included observed case MMRM, per protocol visits MMRM, interval last observation carried forward (LOCF) MMRM, and a hybrid of the per protocol visits and interval LOCF MMRM approaches. Simulation results reveal that the method that best controls the type I error rate is the per protocol visits method. This method is also associated with the least precision among the competing methods. Thus, in confirmatory clinical trials wherein control of type I error rates is critical, per protocol visits MMRM is recommended. However, in exploratory trials where strict type I error control is not as critical, one may prefer interval LOCF MMRM due to its increased precision. Points to consider with respect to both study design (e.g., assigning schedule of events) and subsequent analysis are offered.},

Among 576 patients in TIMI 4 and 5 with 1-year follow-up, a nonfatal unsatisfactory outcome end point was reached in hospital in 45{\%} of patients. Compared with patients without such an end point, patients with an end point had a relative risk of 1-year mortality of 2.5 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.4 to 5.6, p = 0.001). For individual components, new-onset severe congestive heart failure/shock had a relative risk of 4.6(p = 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}40{\%} had a relative risk of 3.5 (p = 0.006), recurrent myocardial infarction had a relative risk of 2.2 (p = 0.047), and TIMI flow grade {\textless}2 at 90 minutes had a relative risk of 2.2 (p = 0.005). Our findings show that these nonfatal in-hospital end points and the composite end point are associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality and as such are valid predictive survival markers for use in clinical trials.},

abstract = {AIM: To investigate if pain area in patients with chronic pain could be measured by a computerized assessment on previously marked pain drawings on paper figures and to analyze the further application of the method.

METHODS: Seventy-two patients (54 women and 18 men) who were admitted to Ume{\aa} University Hospital during 2003 for assessment of chronic pain answered a set of questionnaires (pain intensity on the visual analog scale [VAS], disability on the Disability Rating Index [DRI], life satisfaction on the LiSat-11) and filled in pain drawings on paper figures of the human body. The pain drawings were later analyzed by using computerized assessment.

RESULTS: Women marked a greater pain area than men, but the difference was not significant (p =0.433). No significant difference was shown for the previous seven days between men and women on the VAS (p =0.914), DRI (p =0.493), or LiSat-11 (p =0.124). A statistically significant correlation was found between pain area and VAS for the previous seven days (r =0.250; p =0.046). Pain area was statistically significantly correlated to the DRI (r =0.336; p =0.014) and close to negatively correlated to the LiSat-11 (r =0.687; p =0.057).

CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that pain drawing area could be measured by a computerized assessment of pain drawings. The method points to the possibility of relating pain area with other instruments. In the present study, an association between the patients' pain drawing area and pain intensity and between pain area and level of activity was shown.},

This study was developed by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), a consortium of clinical research centers actively involved in AD research. The major goal of the consortium is to design and conduct clinical investigations leading to the development of treatments for AD. This study uses a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial, parallel group design to test two drugs for the treatment of AD. The primary outcome of the study is the time to reach any one of the following four endpoints: death, institutionalization, loss of two of three basic activities of daily living, and progression of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stage from 2 to 3. Patients with moderately severe disease (CDR = 2) were enrolled and evaluated 10 times over a period of 2 years to determine if these agents reduce the time to reach any endpoint. A database from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease indicated adequate power analyses to observe a treatment effect on this clinically meaningful outcome measure. Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the population are provided. The rationale for the choice of a factorial design, the use of a novel, clinically meaningful endpoint, and the selection of a cohort of patients with AD of moderate severity are discussed.},

Sample size estimates reported in this literature vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, including the statistical methods and model assumptions used in their calculation. We review this literature and suggest standards for reporting power calculation results. Regardless of the statistical methods used, studies consistently find that volumetric neuroimaging measures of regions of interest, such as hippocampal volume, outperform global cognitive scales traditionally used in clinical treatment trials in terms of the number of subjects required to detect a fixed percentage slowing of the rate of change observed in demented and cognitively impaired populations. However, statistical methods, model assumptions, and parameter estimates used in power calculations are often not reported in sufficient detail to be of maximum utility. We review the factors that influence sample size estimates, and discuss outstanding issues relevant to planning longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease.},

@article{Dixon2011b,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically, four divisions of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) that manage clinical trials and oversee data and safety monitoring have operated fairly autonomously with respect to their approaches to Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) operations. We recognized the need for a revised policy on DSMB operations in an effort to encourage greater harmonization of procedures across the four divisions.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the considerations that motivated the development of the new policy, summarize current DSMB policies and ongoing harmonization efforts across the four divisions, and offer some recommendations for DSMB operations in the hope that other organizations may benefit from our experience.

METHODS: From 2005 to 2009, a working group undertook a review of DSMB responsibilities, policies, and operations. We analyzed and summarized the final policy document that the working group produced, gathered data describing current DSMB activities, and developed a tabular, cross-sectional overview highlighting how divisions are harmonizing their DSMB operations.

RESULTS: In 2010, there were 44 DSMBs in NIAID monitoring 169 protocols, and those DSMBs conducted 209 reviews of the protocols. Review and analysis of DSMB practices across the four divisions have led to recommendations for efficient and successful DSMB operations: adopt an inclusive approach, whereby the trial investigators assist in the process of forming and utilizing DSMBs; structures other than DSMBs can often provide many of the features of DSMBs but with greater flexibility in membership, access to interim data, and scheduling; the trial protocol should specify what safety and other concerns should trigger a DSMB review and what data should be included in prespecified reviews; present data in thoughtful and user-friendly ways that answer specific questions; allow sufficient time to plan for working with the DSMB.

LIMITATIONS: We recognize that NIAID's specific circumstances and DSMB policy may not apply to the operation of DSMBs in every organization. Nevertheless, we believe that useful lessons can be learned from our experiences and efforts toward harmonization.

CONCLUSIONS: Homogeneity in DSMB operations and management has appeal as a matter of organizational policy and efficiency. Some limited flexibility, as long as it honors fundamental principles of independence, confidentiality of interim trial results, and clear lines of reporting and approval, may be appropriate on occasion. NIAID's 2009 institute-level policy established a collective understanding of the important contribution that DSMBs make to the responsible conduct of clinical trials. Thinking will continue to evolve, leading to further policy refinements and the continued assurance of patient safety in our clinical trials.},

Quite often the data for each patient may be effectively summarized by a pre-treatment mean and a post-treatment mean. Analysis of covariance is the method of choice and its superiority over analysis of post-treatment means or analysis of mean changes is quantified, as regards both reduced variance and avoidance of bias, using a simple model for the covariance structure between time points. Quantitative consideration is also given to practical issues in the design of repeated measures studies: the merits of having more than one pre-treatment measurement are demonstrated, and methods for determining sample sizes in repeated measures designs are provided. Several examples from clinical trials are presented, and broad practical recommendations are made. The examples support the value of the compound symmetry assumption as a realistic simplification in quantitative planning of repeated measures trials. The analysis using summary statistics makes no such assumption. However, allowance in design for alternative non-equal correlation structures can and should be made when necessary.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) was designed to address whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

METHODS: ADAPT was a randomized, double-placebo-controlled, multicenter chemoprevention trial conducted at six U.S. dementia research clinics. At entry, participants were required to test "normal" on a battery of cognitive tests and to be age 70+ with a family history of Alzheimer-like dementia. Persons were randomly assigned to 200 mg b.i.d. celecoxib (Celebrex, Pfizer), 220 mg b.i.d. naproxen sodium (Aleve, Bayer), or placebo. The primary outcome measure was AD. Secondary outcome measures were cognitive decline and measures related to safety of the treatments when used long term. ADAPT was designed to detect a 30{\%} reduction in AD incidence with 80{\%} power. The estimated sample size requirement was 2,625.

RESULTS: Enrollment began in March 2001 and ended in December 2004 when treatments were suspended because of concerns regarding cardiovascular safety of the treatments. Followup ranged from 1 to 46 months. The achieved enrollment was 2,528. Recruitment was achieved primarily via mailings to people aged 70+ living in the catchment areas of the six field sites.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to inform the design of randomized clinical trials in early-stage manifest Huntington's disease through analysis of longitudinal data from TRACK-Huntington's Disease (TRACK-HD), a multicenter observational study. METHODS We compute sample sizes required for trials with candidate clinical, functional, and imaging outcomes, whose aims are to reduce rates of change. The calculations use a 2-stage approach: first using linear mixed models to estimate mean rates of change and components of variability from TRACK-HD data and second using these to predict sample sizes for a range of trial designs. RESULTS For each outcome, the primary drivers of the required sample size were the anticipated treatment effect and the duration of treatment. Extending durations from 1 to 2 years yielded large sample size reductions. Including interim visits and incorporating stratified randomization on predictors of outcome together with covariate adjustment gave more modest, but nontrivial, benefits. Caudate atrophy, expressed as a percentage of its baseline, was the outcome that gave smallest required sample sizes. DISCUSSION Here we consider potential required sample sizes for clinical trials estimated from naturalistic observation of longitudinal change. Choice among outcome measures for a trial must additionally consider their relevance to patients and the expected effect of the treatment under study. For all outcomes considered, our results provide compelling arguments for 2-year trials, and we also demonstrate the benefits of incorporating stratified randomization coupled with covariate adjustment, particularly for trials with caudate atrophy as the primary outcome. The benefits of enrichment are more debatable, with statistical benefits offset by potential recruitment difficulties and reduced generalizability. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

@article{Winkens2005a,
abstract = {In repeated measures studies, equidistant time-points do not always yield efficient treatment effect estimators. In the present paper, the optimal allocation of time-points is calculated for a small number of repeated measures, different covariance structures and linearly divergent treatment effects. The gain in efficiency of the treatment effect estimator by using optimally allocated time-points instead of equidistant time-points or by adding optimally spaced measures (at the expense of patients) is then computed. The assumed covariance structure is crucial for the results. For a compound symmetric covariance structure, a large gain in efficiency is obtained by adding repeated measures at the end of the study. For a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure, highly efficient treatment effect estimators are obtained with only two repeated measures, i.e. at the start and at the end of the study. For a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure including measurement error, the gain in efficiency by adding optimally spaced measures depends on the covariance parameter values. The gain in efficiency is similar with or without a random intercept. For a fixed study budget, the commonly used design with more than two equally spaced measures was never optimal for the linear cost function and covariance structures that were used. If the covariance structure is unknown, the optimal design based on a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure with measurement error is preferable in terms of robustness against misspecification of the covariance structure. The numerical results are illustrated by two examples.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In microarray experiments, missing entries arise from blemishes on the chips. In large-scale studies, virtually every chip contains some missing entries and more than 90{\%} of the genes are affected. Many analysis methods require a full set of data. Either those genes with missing entries are excluded, or the missing entries are filled with estimates prior to the analyses. This study compares methods of missing value estimation.

RESULTS: Two evaluation metrics of imputation accuracy are employed. First, the root mean squared error measures the difference between the true values and the imputed values. Second, the number of mis-clustered genes measures the difference between clustering with true values and that with imputed values; it examines the bias introduced by imputation to clustering. The Gaussian mixture clustering with model averaging imputation is superior to all other imputation methods, according to both evaluation metrics, on both time-series (correlated) and non-time series (uncorrelated) data sets.},

This foundation is a recursive polynomial relation. We further show that the network algorithm is equivalent to a stage-wise implementation of this recursion while the FFT algorithm is based on performing the same recursion at complex roots of unity. Our empirical results for the Pearson X2, likelihood ratio, and Freeman-Halton statistics show that the network algorithm, or equivalently, the recursive polynomial multiplication algorithm is superior to the FFT algorithm with respect to computing speed and accuracy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the shape of the trajectories of Alzheimer disease biomarkers as a function of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal registries from the Mayo Clinic and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

PATIENTS: Two different samples (n = 343 and n = 598) were created that spanned the cognitive spectrum from normal to Alzheimer disease dementia. Subgroup analyses were performed in members of both cohorts (n = 243 and n = 328) who were amyloid positive at baseline.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The shape of biomarker trajectories as a function of MMSE score, adjusted for age, was modeled and described as baseline (cross-sectional) and within-subject longitudinal effects. Biomarkers evaluated were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A$\beta$42 and tau levels, amyloid and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging, and structural magnetic resonance imaging.

RESULTS: Baseline biomarker values generally worsened (ie, nonzero slope) with lower baseline MMSE score. Baseline hippocampal volume, amyloid positron emission tomography, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography values plateaued (ie, nonlinear slope) with lower MMSE score in 1 or more analyses. Longitudinally, within-subject rates of biomarker change were associated with worsening MMSE score. Nonconstant within-subject rates (deceleration) of biomarker change were found in only 1 model.

CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker trajectory shapes by MMSE score were complex and were affected by interactions with age and APOE status. Nonlinearity was found in several baseline effects models. Nonconstant within-subject rates of biomarker change were found in only 1 model, likely owing to limited within-subject longitudinal follow-up. Creating reliable models that describe the full trajectories of Alzheimer disease biomarkers will require significant additional longitudinal data in individual participants.},

abstract = {Pre-symptomatic (or Preclinical) Alzheimer's Disease is defined by biomarker evidence of fibrillar amyloid beta pathology in the absence of clinical symptoms. Clinical trials in this early phase of disease are challenging due to the slow rate of disease progression as measured by periodic cognitive performance tests or by transition to a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment. In a multisite study, experts provide diagnoses by central chart review without the benefit of in-person assessment. We use a simulation study to demonstrate that models of repeated cognitive assessments detect treatment effects more efficiently compared to models of time-to-progression to an endpoint such as change in diagnosis. Multivariate continuous data are simulated from a Bayesian joint mixed effects model fit to data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Simulated progression events are algorithmically derived from the continuous assessments using a random forest model fit to the same data. We find that power is approximately doubled with models of repeated continuous outcomes compared to the time-to-progression analysis. The simulations also demonstrate that a plausible informative missing data pattern can induce a bias which inflates treatment effects, yet 5{\%} Type I error is maintained.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our goal was to forecast the global burden of Alzheimer's disease and evaluate the potential impact of interventions that delay disease onset or progression. METHODS: A stochastic, multistate model was used in conjunction with United Nations worldwide population forecasts and data from epidemiological studies of the risks of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: In 2006, the worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was 26.6 million. By 2050, the prevalence will quadruple, by which time 1 in 85 persons worldwide will be living with the disease. We estimate about 43{\%} of prevalent cases need a high level of care, equivalent to that of a nursing home. If interventions could delay both disease onset and progression by a modest 1 year, there would be nearly 9.2 million fewer cases of the disease in 2050, with nearly the entire decline attributable to decreases in persons needing a high level of care. CONCLUSIONS: We face a looming global epidemic of Alzheimer's disease as the world's population ages. Modest advances in therapeutic and preventive strategies that lead to even small delays in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease can significantly reduce the global burden of this disease.},

@article{Carlin2005,
abstract = {Twin studies have long been recognized for their value in learning about the aetiology of disease and specifically for their potential for separating genetic effects from environmental effects. The recent upsurge of interest in life-course epidemiology and the study of developmental influences on later health has provided a new impetus to study twins as a source of unique insights. Twins are of special interest because they provide naturally matched pairs where the confounding effects of a large number of potentially causal factors (such as maternal nutrition or gestation length) may be removed by comparisons between twins who share them. The traditional tool of epidemiological 'risk factor analysis' is the regression model, but it is not straightforward to transfer standard regression methods to twin data, because the analysis needs to reflect the paired structure of the data, which induces correlation between twins. This paper reviews the use of more specialized regression methods for twin data, based on generalized least squares or linear mixed models, and explains the relationship between these methods and the commonly used approach of analysing within-twin-pair difference values. Methods and issues of interpretation are illustrated using an example from a recent study of the association between birth weight and cord blood erythropoietin. We focus on the analysis of continuous outcome measures but review additional complexities that arise with binary outcomes. We recommend the use of a general model that includes separate regression coefficients for within-twin-pair and between-pair effects, and provide guidelines for the interpretation of estimates obtained under this model. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; {\$}67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by \beta-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, \beta-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.},

abstract = {Although sample size calculations have become an important element in the design of research projects, such methods for studies involving current status data are scarce. Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

@article{Floriani2008a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although interim analysis approaches in clinical trials are widely known, information on current practice of planned monitoring is still scarce. Reports of studies rarely include details on the strategies for both data monitoring and interim analysis. The aim of this project is to investigate the forms of monitoring used in cancer clinical trials and in particular to gather information on the role of interim analyses in the data monitoring process of a clinical trial. This study focused on the prevalence of different types of interim analyses and data monitoring in cancer clinical trials.

METHODS: Source of investigation were the protocols of cancer clinical trials included in the Italian registry of clinical trials from 2000 to 2005. Evaluation was restricted to protocols of randomised studies with a time to event endpoint, such as overall survival (OS) or progression free survival (PFS). A template data extraction form was developed and tested in a pilot phase. Selection of relevant protocols and data extraction were performed independently by two evaluators, with differences in the data assessment resolved by consensus with a third reviewer, referring back to the original protocol. Information was obtained on a) general characteristics of the protocol b) disease localization and patient setting; c) study design d) interim analyses; e) DSMC.

RESULTS: The analysis of the collected protocols reveals that 70.7{\%} of the protocols incorporate statistical interim analysis plans, but only 56{\%} have also a DSMC and be considered adequately planned. The most concerning cases are related to lack of any form of monitoring (20.0{\%} of the protocols), and the planning of interim analysis, without DSMC (14.7{\%}).

CONCLUSION: The results indicate that there is still insufficient attention paid to the implementation of interim analysis.},

abstract = {Longitudinal changes in a population of interest are often heterogeneous and influenced by a combination of baseline factors. In such cases, classical linear mixed effects models [Laird NM, Ware JH. Random-effects models for longitudinal data. Biometrics. 1982;38:963–974.] for the mean structure provide poor fit to the data. We propose regression tree methodology for the longitudinal data identifying and characterizing homogeneous subgroups. Currently available regression tree construction methods are either limited to a repeated measures scenario or combine the heterogeneity among subgroups with the random inter-subject variability. We propose a longitudinal classification and regression tree (LongCART) algorithm under conditional inference framework that overcomes these limitations utilizing a two-step approach. The LongCART first selects the partitioning variable via a parameter instability test and then finds the optimal split for the selected partitioning variable. Thus, at each node, the decision of further splitting is type I error controlled, guarding against variable selection bias, over-fitting and spurious splitting. We obtained asymptotic results for the proposed instability test and examined its finite sample behavior through simulation studies. Comparative performance of LongCART algorithm was evaluated empirically via simulation studies. Finally, we applied LongCART to study the longitudinal changes in choline levels among HIV-positive patients.},

abstract = {Skew-normal and skew-t distributions have proved to be useful for capturing skewness and kurtosis in data directly without transformation. Recently, finite mixtures of such distributions have been considered as a more general tool for handling heterogeneous data involving asymmetric behaviors across subpopulations. We consider such mixture models for both univariate as well as multivariate data. This allows robust modeling of high-dimensional multimodal and asymmetric data generated by popular biotechnological platforms such as flow cytometry. We develop Bayesian inference based on data augmentation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In addition to the latent allocations, data augmentation is based on a stochastic representation of the skew-normal distribution in terms of a random-effects model with truncated normal random effects. For finite mixtures of skew normals, this leads to a Gibbs sampling scheme that draws from standard densities only. This MCMC scheme is extended to mixtures of skew-t distributions based on representing the skew-t distribution as a scale mixture of skew normals. As an important application of our new method, we demonstrate how it provides a new computational framework for automated analysis of high-dimensional flow cytometric data. Using multivariate skew-normal and skew-t mixture models, we could model non-Gaussian cell populations rigorously and directly without transformation or projection to lower dimensions.},

CONCLUSION: Trial-bank publishing of these 162 items would capture into computer-understandable form all the trial information needed for critically appraising and synthesizing trial results.

abstract = {We describe a sequential importance samplin g (SIS) procedure for analyzing two-way zero–one or contingency tables with fixed marginal sums. An essential feature of the new method is that it samples the columns of the table progressively according to certain special distri- butions. Our method produces Monte Carlo samples that are remarkab ly close to the uniform distribution, enabling one to approximate closely the null distributions of various test statistics about these tab les. Our method compares favorably with other existing Monte Carlo- based algorithms, and sometimes is a few orders of magnitude more efficient. In particular, compared with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based approaches, our importanc e sampling method not only is more efficient in terms of absolute running time and frees one from pondering over the mixing issue, but also provides an easy and accurate estimate of the total number of tables with fixed marginal sums, which is far more difficult for an MCMC method to achieve.},

@article{Shan2018a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The British Psychological Society This research was motivated by a clinical trial design for a cognitive study. The pilot study was a matched-pairs design where some data are missing, specifically the missing data coming at the end of the study. Existing approaches to determine sample size are all based on asymptotic approaches (e.g., the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach). When the sample size in a clinical trial is small to medium, these asymptotic approaches may not be appropriate for use due to the unsatisfactory Type I and II error rates. For this reason, we consider the exact unconditional approach to compute the sample size for a matched-pairs study with incomplete data. Recommendations are made for each possible missingness pattern by comparing the exact sample sizes based on three commonly used test statistics, with the existing sample size calculation based on the GEE approach. An example from a real surgeon-reviewers study is used to illustrate the application of the exact sample size calculation in study designs.},

By reviewing papers published during the period January 2000-January 2010, this paper discusses recent developments with respect to methodology, applications, and lessons learned in the use of CTS in the development and clinical use of specific drugs.

@article{Mackin2012,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the degree to which longitudinal stability of subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD) is associated with conversion to dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

METHODS: Data from 405 MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were analyzed. Participants were evaluated at baseline and 12-month intervals over 3 years. Participants were designated as MCI converters if dementia was diagnosed within 3 years or as cognitively stable MCI if dementia was not diagnosed during this interval. SSD were evaluated utilizing the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Endorsement of specific SSD at baseline and the stability of SSD over 36 months were compared between the two MCI groups.

RESULTS: Baseline symptom endorsement and stability of total GDS scores did not differentiate MCI groups. Worsening of four individual items from the GDS over time (memory problems, feelings of helplessness, loss of interest, and preference for staying at home) differentiated MCI converters from cognitively stable MCI (p {\textless} 0.05 for all). However, only increased endorsement of memory symptoms over time was associated with progression to dementia after controlling for other clinical variables (p = 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: SSD in MCI participants largely consist of cognitive symptoms and activity limitations, and the stability of SSD over time differentiated the MCI groups better than baseline endorsement of symptoms. However, the only significant predictor of conversion to dementia was increased endorsement of memory problems, which likely represents insight into cognitive problems more than depressive symptomatology in MCI individuals.},

@article{Holland2012,
abstract = {Structural changes in neuroanatomical subregions can be measured using serial magnetic resonance imaging scans, and provide powerful biomarkers for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has made a large database of longitudinal scans available, with one of its primary goals being to explore the utility of structural change measures for assessing treatment effects in clinical trials of putative disease-modifying therapies. Several ADNI-funded research laboratories have calculated such measures from the ADNI database and made their results publicly available. Here, using sample size estimates, we present a comparative analysis of the overall results that come from the application of each laboratory's extensive processing stream to the ADNI database. Obtaining accurate measures of change requires correcting for potential bias due to the measurement methods themselves; and obtaining realistic sample size estimates for treatment response, based on longitudinal imaging measures from natural history studies such as ADNI, requires calibrating measured change in patient cohorts with respect to longitudinal anatomical changes inherent to normal aging. We present results showing that significant longitudinal change is present in healthy control subjects who test negative for amyloid-$\beta$ pathology. Therefore, sample size estimates as commonly reported from power calculations based on total structural change in patients, rather than change in patients relative to change in healthy controls, are likely to be unrealistically low for treatments targeting amyloid-related pathology. Of all the measures publicly available in ADNI, thinning of the entorhinal cortex quantified with the Quarc methodology provides the most powerful change biomarker.},

abstract = {Clinical trial simulation (CTS) allows the investigation of the influence of design characteristics on important aspects of clinical trials such as power and type I error. Simulation scenarios may be critical to decision making and prevention of study failure. The analysis and simulation of clinical trials in depression have, however, suffered from a lack of disease/dropout models that describe the individual time course of the clinical scale of interest. We propose a new model with dual random effects (DREM) derived from functional data analysis, which provides unbiased estimates of parameters and is suitable for the purposes of clinical trial simulation. A comparison of model performance is presented, along with standard statistical methods using various goodness-of-fit criteria. Our results show that data simulated using the DREM closely match individual patient data, including real-life dropout scenarios. In addition, parameterization in terms of interindividual variability ensures easier explanation of findings to clinical scientists, who ultimately make the relevant decisions.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE As Alzheimer disease (AD) research moves to intervene in presymptomatic phases of the disease, we must develop outcome measures sensitive to the earliest disease-related changes. OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility of a cognitive composite outcome for clinically normal elderly participants with evidence of AD pathology using the ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS With the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES For the 2 studies that collected data on A$\beta$ levels (ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD "A$\beta$-positive" placebo group and compare them with an "A$\beta$-negative" group. For the study that did not include data on A$\beta$ levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we grouped participants by the presence of APOE-$\epsilon$4 and by clinical progression. RESULTS In ADNI, A$\beta$-positive participants showed more decline than did A$\beta$-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean [SE] difference, -1.239 [0.522] [95{\%} CI, -2.263 to -0.215]; P = .02). In AIBL, the mean (SE) difference is significant at both 18 months (-1.009 [0.406] [95{\%} CI, -1.805 to -0.213]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.404 [0.452] [95{\%} CI, -2.290 to -0.519]; P = .002). In the ADCS-PI study, APOE-$\epsilon$4 allele carriers performed significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC at 24 months (mean [SE] score, -0.742 [0.294] [95{\%} CI, -1.318 to -0.165]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.531 [0.469] [95{\%} CI, -2.450 to -0.612]; P = .001). In the ADCS-PI study, cognitively normal participants who progress from a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 are significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC than cognitively normal participants who are stable with a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 at months 12, 24, and 36 (mean [SE] ADCS-PACC score, -4.471 [0.702] [95{\%} CI, -5.848 to -3.094]; P {\textless} .001). Using pilot estimates of variance and assuming 500 participants per group with 30{\%} attrition and a 5{\%} $\alpha$ level, we project 80{\%} power to detect effects in the range of $\Delta$ = 0.467 to 0.733 on the ADCS-PACC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Analyses of at-risk cognitively normal populations suggest that we can reliably measure the first signs of cognitive decline with the ADCS-PACC. These analyses also suggest the feasibility of secondary prevention trials.},

abstract = {Chronic exposure to glucocorticoids might result not only in insulin resistance or cognitive deficits, but it is also considered as a risk factor for pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. Propranolol is a $\beta$-adrenergic antagonist commonly used in the treatment of hypertension or acute anxiety. The effects of propranolol (5 mg/kg) have been tested in a model of chronic corticosterone administration (100 $\mu$g/ml, 4 wk) in drinking water. Corticosterone administration led to cognitive impairment in the novel object recognition test that was reversed by propranolol. Increased levels of A$\beta$ in the hippocampus of corticosterone-treated mice were counteracted by propranolol treatment, purportedly through an increased IDE expression. Chronic corticosterone treatment induced responses characteristic of insulin resistance, as increased peripheral insulin levels, decreased activation of the insulin receptor (pIR) and decreased associated intracellular pathways (pAkt). These effects might be related to a decreased c-Jun N terminal kinase 1 expression. Again, propranolol was able to counteract all corticosterone-induced effects. One of the main kinases involved in tau phosphorylation, glycogen synthase kinase 3$\beta$ (GSK3$\beta$), which is inactivated by phosphorylation by pAkt, was found to be decreased after corticosterone and increased after propranolol treatment. Concomitant changes in pTau expression were found. Overall, these data further strengthen the potential of propranolol as a therapeutic agent for pathologies associated with the interaction glucocorticoids-insulin resistance and the development of relevant cellular processes for Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {In longitudinal clinical studies, after randomization at baseline, subjects are followed for a period of time for development of symptoms. A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) can be used to analyze data from such studies. Fitzmaurice et al. (2004) outlined five approaches for handling baseline responses in an MMRM analysis. They are: (1) Retain the baselines as part of the outcome vector and make no assumptions about group differences in the mean response at baseline. (2) Retain the baselines as part of the outcome vector and assume the group means are equal at baseline. (3) Subtract the baselines from all of the remaining post-baseline responses, and analyze the differences from baseline. (4) Use the baselines as a covariate in the analysis of the post-baseline responses, assuming homogeneous regression slopes. (5) Use the baselines as a covariate in the analysis of the post-baseline responses, allowing different regression slopes. In this paper, we evaluate these five approaches in the presence of data missing at random. We evaluate the approaches based on the bias of the estimate and the coverage accuracy of the confidence interval. The results suggest that strategies 2 and 5 are recommended.},

abstract = {We have performed a systematic review to summarize current knowledge concerning factors related to survival in ALS and to evaluate the implications of these data for clinical trials design. The median survival time from onset to death ranges from 20 to 48 months, but 10-20{\%} of ALS patients have a survival longer than 10 years. Older age and bulbar onset are consistently reported to have a worse outcome. There are conflicting data on gender, diagnostic delay and El Escorial criteria. The rate of symptom progression was revealed to be an independent prognostic factor. Psychosocial factors, FTD, nutritional status, and respiratory function are also related to ALS outcome. The effect of enteral nutrition on survival is still unclear, while NIPPV has been found to improve survival. There are no well established biological markers of progression, although some are likely to emerge in the near future. These findings have relevant implications for the design of future trials. Randomization, besides the type of onset, should take into account age, respiratory status at entry, and a measure of disease progression pre-entry. Alternative trial designs can include the use of natural history controls, the so-called minimization method for treatment allocation, and the futility approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analyses of individual differences in change may be unintentionally biased when versions of a neuropsychological test used at different follow-ups are not of equivalent difficulty. This study's objective was to compare mean, linear, and equipercentile equating methods and demonstrate their utility in longitudinal research.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE, N = 1,401) study is a longitudinal randomized trial of cognitive training. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 819) is an observational cohort study. Nonequivalent alternate versions of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) were administered in both studies.

RESULTS: Using visual displays, raw and mean-equated AVLT scores in both studies showed obvious nonlinear trajectories in reference groups that should show minimal change and poor equivalence over time (ps ≤ .001), and raw scores demonstrated poor fits in models of within-person change (root mean square errors of approximation, RMSEAs {\textgreater} 0.12). Linear and equipercentile equating produced more similar means in reference groups (ps ≥ .09) and performed better in growth models (RMSEAs {\textless} 0.05).

CONCLUSION: Equipercentile equating is the preferred equating method because it accommodates tests more difficult than a reference test at different percentiles of performance and performs well in models of within-person trajectory. The method has broad applications in both clinical and research settings to enhance the ability to use nonequivalent test forms.},

abstract = {Little research has been conducted on the statistical properties of composite measures comprising linear combinations of continuous component scales. We assessed the quantitative relationship between the composites and their individual components regarding their abilities to detect treatment effects. In particular, we developed the mathematical derivation of the treatment effect size of a continuous composite in relation to the treatment effect sizes of its components and proved multiple properties of the composite. We demonstrated that the treatment effect size of a composite is greater than the minimum treatment effect size of its components and that above certain thresholds of correlations of components and ratios of component effect sizes, the composite may outperform its components. Examples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical studies of solanezumab and donepezil using the composite Integrated AD Rating Scale (iADRS) and its components, the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living inventory, instrumental items (ADCS-iADL) were consistent with the theoretical statistical properties. The understanding of the quantitative relationships between continuous composites and their components will be useful in clinical trial design and the development of new scales and composites across therapeutic areas.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: For inferring a treatment effect from the difference between a treated and untreated group on a quantitative outcome measured before and after treatment, current methods are analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the outcome with the baseline as covariate, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of change from baseline. This article compares both methods on power and bias, for randomized and nonrandomized studies. Methods: The methods are compared by writing both as a regression model and as a repeated measures model, and are applied to a nonrandomized study of preventing depression. Results: In randomized studies both methods are unbiased, but ANCOVA has more power. If treatment assignment is based on the baseline, only ANCOVA is unbiased. In nonrandomized studies with preexisting groups differing at baseline, the two methods cannot both be unbiased, and may contradict each other. In the study of depression, ANCOVA suggests absence, but ANOVA of change suggests presence, of a treatment effect. The methods differ because ANCOVA assumes absence of a baseline difference. Conclusion: In randomized studies and studies with treatment assignment depending on the baseline, ANCOVA must be used. In nonrandomized studies of preexisting groups, ANOVA of change seems less biased than ANCOVA, but two control groups and two baseline measurements are recommended. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Random intercept models for binary data are useful tools for addressing between-subject heterogeneity. Unlike linear models, the non-linearity of link functions used for binary data force a distinction between marginal and conditional interpretations. This distinction is blurred in probit models with a normally distributed random intercept because the resulting model implies a probit marginal link as well. That is, this model is closed in the sense that the distribution associated with the marginal and conditional link functions and the random effect distribution are all of the same family. It is shown that the closure property is also attained when the distributions associated with the conditional and marginal link functions and the random effect distribution are mixtures of normals. The resulting flexible family of models is demonstrated to be related to several others present in the literature and can be used to synthesize several seemingly disparate modeling approaches. In addition, this family of models offers considerable computational benefits. A diverse series of examples is explored that illustrates the wide applicability of this approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report the psychometric properties of an alternative instrument to the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, a neuropsychological test battery (NTB) for measuring drug efficacy in Alzheimer disease clinical trials.

DESIGN: The NTB was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AN1792(QS-21) (synthetic beta-amyloid plus an adjuvant) (300 patients) and isotonic sodium chloride solution (72 patients). The test-retest reliability of the NTB was examined, and the NTB was correlated with other cognitive (cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination) and functional (Disability Assessment Scale for Dementia and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes) measures. In addition, a factor analysis was performed on NTB components. Finally, the sensitivity of the NTB to change was assessed as a function of Mini-Mental State Examination performance.

RESULTS: The NTB had high test-retest reliability at 6 (Pearson product moment correlation [r] = 0.92) and 12 (r = 0.88) months. Internal consistency was high (Cronbach alpha = 0.84). The correlations between the NTB z score and scores on traditional measures of cognition and function were significantly different from 0 (P {\textless} .001). A factor analysis yielded "memory" and "executive function" factors. The NTB z score declined linearly over 1 year in patients receiving placebo and, in contrast to the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale, demonstrated similar declines in patients with high (21-26) and low (15-20) Mini-Mental State Examination scores at baseline.

CONCLUSIONS: The NTB exhibits excellent psychometric properties and seems to be a reliable and sensitive measure of cognitive change in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. The psychometric properties of the NTB suggest that it may have particular utility in evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials in which patients with mild Alzheimer disease are included.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of variance (ANOVA), change-score analysis (CSA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) respond differently to baseline imbalance in randomized controlled trials. However, no empirical studies appear to have quantified the differential bias and precision of estimates derived from these methods of analysis, and their relative statistical power, in relation to combinations of levels of key trial characteristics. This simulation study therefore examined the relative bias, precision and statistical power of these three analyses using simulated trial data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: 126 hypothetical trial scenarios were evaluated (126 000 datasets), each with continuous data simulated by using a combination of levels of: treatment effect; pretest-posttest correlation; direction and magnitude of baseline imbalance. The bias, precision and power of each method of analysis were calculated for each scenario.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Compared to the unbiased estimates produced by ANCOVA, both ANOVA and CSA are subject to bias, in relation to pretest-posttest correlation and the direction of baseline imbalance. Additionally, ANOVA and CSA are less precise than ANCOVA, especially when pretest-posttest correlation ≥ 0.3. When groups are balanced at baseline, ANCOVA is at least as powerful as the other analyses. Apparently greater power of ANOVA and CSA at certain imbalances is achieved in respect of a biased treatment effect.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Across a range of correlations between pre- and post-treatment scores and at varying levels and direction of baseline imbalance, ANCOVA remains the optimum statistical method for the analysis of continuous outcomes in RCTs, in terms of bias, precision and statistical power.},

abstract = {It is well known that the statistical power of randomized controlled trials with a continuous outcome can be increased by using a pre-randomization baseline measure of the outcome variable as a covariate in the analysis. For a trial where the outcome measure is a rate, for example in a therapeutic trial in Alzheimer's disease, the relevant covariate is a pre-randomization measure of that rate. Obtaining this requires separating the total follow-up period into two periods. In the first 'run-in' period all patients would be 'off-treatment' to facilitate the calculation of baseline atrophy rates. In the second 'on-treatment' period half of the patients, selected at random, would be switched onto active treatment with the others remaining off treatment. In this paper we use linear mixed models to establish a methodological framework that is then used to assess the extent to which such designs can increase statistical power. We illustrate our methodology with two examples. The first is a design with three evenly spaced time points analysed with a standard random slopes model. The second is a model for repeated 'direct' measures of changes used for the analysis of imaging studies with visits at multiple time points. We show that run-in designs can materially reduce sample size provided that true between-subject variability in rates is large relative to measurement error.},

abstract = {Valid analyses of longitudinal data can be problematic, particularly when subjects dropout prior to completing the trial for reasons related to the outcome. Regulatory agencies often favor the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach for imputing missing values in the primary analysis of clinical trials. However, recent evidence suggests that likelihood-based analyses developed under the missing at random framework provide viable alternatives. The within-subject error correlation structure is often the means by which such methods account for the bias from missing data. The objective of this study was to extend previous work that used only one correlation structure by including several common correlation structures in order to assess the effect of the correlation structure in the data, and how it is modeled, on Type I error rates and power from a likelihood-based repeated measures analysis (MMRM), using LOCF for comparison. Data from four realistic clinical trial scenarios were simulated using autoregressive, compound symmetric and unstructured correlation structures. When the correct correlation structure was fit, MMRM provided better control of Type I error and power than LOCF. Although misfitting the correlation structure in MMRM inflated Type I error and altered power, misfitting the structure was typically less deleterious than using LOCF. In fact, simply specifying an unstructured matrix for use in MMRM, regardless of the true correlation structure, yielded superior control of Type I error than LOCF in every scenario. The present and previous investigations have shown that the bias in LOCF is influenced by several factors and interactions between them. Hence, it is difficult to precisely anticipate the direction and magnitude of bias from LOCF in practical situations. However, in scenarios where the overall tendency is for patient improvement, LOCF tends to: 1) overestimate a drug's advantage when dropout is higher in the comparator and underestimate the advantage when dropout is lower in the comparator; 2) overestimate a drug's advantage when the advantage is maximum at intermediate time points and underestimate the advantage when the advantage increases over time; and 3) have a greater likelihood of overestimating a drug's advantage when the advantage is small. In scenarios in which the overall tendency is for patient worsening, the above biases are reversed. In the simulation scenarios considered in this study, which were patterned after acute phase neuropsychiatric clinical trials, the likelihood-based repeated measures approach, implemented with standard software, was more robust to the bias from missing data than LOCF, and choice of correlation structure was not an impediment to its implementation.},

abstract = {Background: The primary analysis in a longitudinal randomized controlled trial is sometimes a comparison of arms at a single time point. While a two-sample t-test is often used, missing data are common in longitudinal studies and decreases power by reducing sample size. Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) can test treatment effects at specific time points, have been shown to give unbiased estimates in certain missing data contexts, and may be more powerful than a two sample t-test. Methods: We conducted a simulation study to compare the performance of a complete-case t-test to a MMRM in terms of power and bias under different missing data mechanisms. Impact of within- and between-person variance, dropout mechanism, and variance-covariance structure were all considered. Results: While both complete-case t-test and MMRM provided unbiased estimation of treatment differences when data were missing completely at random, MMRM yielded an absolute power gain of up to 12 {\%}. The MMRM provided up to 25 {\%} absolute increased power over the t-test when data were missing at random, as well as unbiased estimation. Conclusions: Investigators interested in single time point comparisons should use a MMRM with a contrast to gain power and unbiased estimation of treatment effects instead of a complete-case two sample t-test.},

@article{Hobart2013,
abstract = {Background: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Behavior section (ADAS-Cog) is the most widely used measure of cognitive performance in AD clinical trials. This key role has rightly brought its performance under increased scrutiny with recent research using traditional psychometric methods, questioning the ADAS-Cog's ability to adequately measure early-stage disease. However, given the limitations of traditional psychometric approaches, herein we use the more sophisticated Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT) methods to fully examine the strengths and weaknesses of the ADAS-Cog, and identify potential paths toward its improvement. Methods: We analyzed AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) ADAS-Cog data (675 measurements across four time-points over 2 years) from the AD participants. RMT analysis was undertaken to examine three broad areas: adequacy of scale-to-sample targeting; degree to which, taken together, the ADAS-Cog items adequately perform as a measuring instrument; and how well the scale measured the subjects in the current sample. Results: The 11 ADAS-Cog components mapped-out a measurement continuum, worked together adequately, and were stable across different time-points and samples. However, the scale did not prove to be a good match to the patient sample supporting previous research. RMT analysis also identified problematic "gaps" and "bunching" of the components across the continuum. Conclusion: Although the ADAS-Cog has the building blocks of a good measurement instrument, this sophisticated analysis confirms limitations with potentially serious implications for clinical trials. Importantly, and unlike traditional psychometric methods, our RMT analysis has provided important clues aimed at solving the measurement problems of the ADAS-Cog. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Alzheimer's Association.

Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

Currently available treatments for AD are symptomatic, with modest effect sizes and limited impact on longer term disease outcomes. There have been no newly approved pharmaceutical treatments in the last decade, despite enormous efforts to develop disease-modifying treatments directed at Alzheimer's-associated pathology. An unprecedented collaborative effort of government, regulators, industry, academia, and the community at-large is needed to address this crisis and to develop an actionable plan for rapid progress toward successfully developing effective treatments. Here, we map out a course of action in four key priority areas, including (1) addressing the fundamental mechanisms of disease, with the goal of developing a core set of research tools, a framework for data sharing, and creation of accessible validated and replicated disease models; (2) developing translational research that emphasizes rapid progress in disease model development and better translation from preclinical to clinical stages, deploying leading technologies to more accurately develop predictive models; (3) preventing AD through the development of robust methods and resources to advance trials and creating fundamental resources such as continuous adaptive trials, registries, data repositories, and instrument development; and (4) innovating public/private partnerships and global collaborations, with mechanisms to incentivize collaborations and investments, develop larger precompetitive spaces, and more rapid data sharing.},

Using data from two cohorts of AD patients, a cross-sectional latent variable model of AD was tested with three symptom factors explaining variability in the observed variables after taking a general neurological factor into account. No significant influence of epsilon4 was detected. APOE's effect in AD may occur prior to clinical symptoms, or may simply be more subtle than these instruments can detect.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether genome-wide association study (GWAS)-validated and GWAS-promising candidate loci influence magnetic resonance imaging measures and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) status. DESIGN: Multicenter case-control study of genetic and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. SETTING: Multicenter GWAS. Patients A total of 168 individuals with probable AD, 357 with mild cognitive impairment, and 215 cognitively normal control individuals recruited from more than 50 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative centers in the United States and Canada. All study participants had APOE and genome-wide genetic data available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We investigated the influence of GWAS-validated and GWAS-promising novel AD loci on hippocampal volume, amygdala volume, white matter lesion volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, parahippocampal gyrus thickness, and temporal pole cortex thickness. RESULTS: Markers at the APOE locus were associated with all phenotypes except white matter lesion volume (all false discovery rate-corrected P values {\textless} .001). Novel and established AD loci identified by prior GWASs showed a significant cumulative score-based effect (false discovery rate P = .04) on all analyzed neuroimaging measures. The GWAS-validated variants at the CR1 and PICALM loci and markers at 2 novel loci (BIN1 and CNTN5) showed association with multiple magnetic resonance imaging characteristics (false discovery rate P {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS: Loci associated with AD also influence neuroimaging correlates of this disease. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis identified 2 additional loci of high interest for further study.},

This paper introduces Gen, a general-purpose probabilistic programming system that achieves modeling flexibility and inference efficiency via several novel language constructs: (i) the generative function interface for encapsulating probabilistic models; (ii) interoperable model-ing languages that strike different flexibility/efficiency trade-offs; (iii) combinators that exploit common patterns of conditional independence; and (iv) an inference library that empowers users to implement efficient inference algorithms at a high level of abstraction. We show that Gen outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic programming systems, sometimes by multiple orders of magnitude, on diverse problems including object tracking, estimating 3D body pose from a depth image, and inferring the structure of a time series.

abstract = {Minimization (M) is the most popular algorithm for balancing large numbers of subject variables in treatment groups of small clinical trials. However, its use has been limited because of its complexity, vulnerability to selection bias and lack of a generally accepted method for statistical analysis of the data. Rank-Minimization (RM) is a promising new algorithm. It is less complex since it does not require unique programming for each clinical trial to convert continuous to categorical variables. In this study RM is compared to M for balance of variables and vulnerability to selection bias in 1000 simulated trials using 200 subjects with 15 continuous variables. With RM there were no instances of significant imbalance to cause rejection of the null hypothesis, i.e. a Student's t{\textgreater} or =2, although it occurred in 0.4{\%} of the 15000 tests for M. For moderate imbalance, i.e. 1{\textless} or = t {\textless} 2, the figures were 3{\%} (RM) and 12{\%} (M). The probability of guessing the next assignment was 0.636 (RM) and 0.683 (M). The smaller figure is superior to that of restricted randomization in blocks of five per treatment group. Improvement in balance, a decrease in vulnerability to selection bias and ease of application along with improvements in the statistical analysis should result in the general acceptance of RM for assigning subjects to treatment groups in clinical trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS We assessed whether cognitive and functional decline in community-dwelling patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia were associated with increased societal costs and caregiver burden and time outcomes. METHODS Cognitive decline was defined as a ≥3-point reduction in the Mini-Mental State Examination and functional decline as a decrease in the ability to perform one or more basic items of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) or ≥20{\%} of instrumental ADL items. Total societal costs were estimated from resource use and caregiver hours using 2010 costs. Caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI); caregiver supervision and total hours were collected. RESULTS Of 566 patients with mild AD enrolled in the GERAS study, 494 were suitable for the current analysis. Mean monthly total societal costs were greater for patients showing functional (+61{\%}) or cognitive decline (+27{\%}) compared with those without decline. In relation to a typical mean monthly cost of approximately EUR 1,400 at baseline, this translated into increases over 18 months to EUR 2,254 and 1,778 for patients with functional and cognitive decline, respectively. The number of patients requiring supervision doubled among patients showing functional or cognitive decline compared with those not showing decline, while caregiver total time increased by 70 and 33{\%}, respectively and ZBI total score by 5.3 and 3.4 points, respectively. CONCLUSION Cognitive and, more notably, functional decline were associated with increases in costs and caregiver outcomes in patients with mild AD dementia.},

abstract = {Although increasing in pace, the conversion to Electronic Data Capture (EDC) has been a slow progression. The use of EDC systems should confer improved data integrity, cost savings and a shorter time to study database closure. This will reduce the time to market and cost of new medications. With the current sentiment of the industry suggesting the cost analysis has been accepted to be in favor of EDC, the likely limitation to disseminated use is an inability to implement these systems. If the leadership at the sponsor, clinical research organization and investigator site is cognizant of the barriers to implementation, they can anticipate and mitigate them prior to the users becoming disgruntled and resistant to the new method of data capture. Once understood, barriers such as user input, technical support, user motivation, regulatory requirements, communication with users, timing of implementation, software installation, graphical user interface, identification of bridgers, patient participation, availability of technology, and costs can be better addressed at the beginning of the implementation process and successfully averted. This review discusses these barriers and potential solutions that can assist the clinical trial industry in achieving more wide-spread EDC use and the resulting improvement in operating efficiencies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. Unconditional exact tests are increasingly used in practice for categorical data to increase the power of a study and to make the data analysis approach being consistent with the study design. In a two-arm study with a binary endpoint, p-value based on the exact unconditional Barnard test is computed by maximizing the tail probability over a nuisance parameter with a range from 0 to 1. The traditional grid search method is able to find an approximate maximum with a partition of the parameter space, but it is not accurate and this approach becomes computationally intensive for a study beyond two groups. We propose using a polynomial method to rewrite the tail probability as a polynomial. The solutions from the derivative of the polynomial contain the solution for the global maximum of the tail probability. We use an example from a double-blind randomized Phase II cancer clinical trial to illustrate the application of the proposed polynomial method to achieve an accurate p-value. We also compare the performance of the proposed method and the traditional grid search method under various conditions. We would recommend using this new polynomial method in computing accurate exact unconditional p-values.},

The journal does not exist anymore but the methodology found widespread interest in the scientific community over the past 25 years. The use of such multistage adaptive designs raised many controversial discussions from the beginning on, especially after the publication by Bauer and K{\"{o}}hne 1994 in Biometrics: Broad enthusiasm about potential applications of such designs faced critical positions regarding their statistical efficiency. Despite, or possibly because of, this controversy, the methodology and its areas of applications grew steadily over the years, with significant contributions from statisticians working in academia, industry and agencies around the world. In the meantime, such type of adaptive designs have become the subject of two major regulatory guidance documents in the US and Europe and the field is still evolving. Developments are particularly noteworthy in the most important applications of adaptive designs, including sample size reassessment, treatment selection procedures, and population enrichment designs. In this article, we summarize the developments over the past 25 years from different perspectives. We provide a historical overview of the early days, review the key methodological concepts and summarize regulatory and industry perspectives on such designs. Then, we illustrate the application of adaptive designs with three case studies, including unblinded sample size reassessment, adaptive treatment selection, and adaptive endpoint selection. We also discuss the availability of software for evaluating and performing such designs. We conclude with a critical review of how expectations from the beginning were fulfilled, and - if not - discuss potential reasons why this did not happen.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials generally allocate patients to equal-sized treatment groups. The authors propose that it may be more efficient to allocate unequal proportions of the total sample size to treatments when more than two treatments are being compared.

METHOD: This proposal is illustrated with two examples. One involved a comparison of three treatments and used a dichotomous categorical outcome. The other involved comparison of three treatments and used a continuous measure.

RESULTS: In both examples, a considerable increase in efficiency was realized by reducing the number of patients assigned to the placebo cell.

CONCLUSIONS: Unequal allocation of patients to treatments should be considered when more than two groups are compared.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of agitation is a crucial problem in the care of patients with AD. Although antipsychotic and antidepressant medications and behavior management techniques (BMT) have each been used to treat agitation, clinical trials of these treatments have been characterized by small sample sizes and uncontrolled treatment designs.

OBJECTIVE: To compare haloperidol, trazodone, and BMT with placebo in the treatment of agitation in AD outpatients.

METHODS: A total of 149 patients with AD and their caregivers participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Blind assessment was conducted at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment. The three active treatments were haloperidol, trazodone, and BMT. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included patient agitation, cognition, and function, and caregiver burden.

RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of subjects improved relative to baseline. No significant differences on outcome were obtained between haloperidol (mean dose, 1.8 mg/d), trazodone (mean dose, 200 mg/d), BMT, or placebo. Significantly fewer adverse events of bradykinesia and parkinsonian gait were evident in the BMT arm. No other significant difference in adverse events was seen. Symptoms did not respond differentially to the different treatments.

CONCLUSIONS: Comparable modest reductions in agitation occurred in patients receiving haloperidol, trazodone, BMT, and placebo. More effective pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and combination treatments are needed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine neuropsychological measures among normal individuals that predict time to subsequent cognitive decline.

DESIGN: Cognitive performance, as measured by 6 neuropsychological tests, was examined at baseline. Participants were followed up for approximately 5 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the neuropsychological measures at baseline that predicted time to progression from normal cognition to mild impairment. Comparable data also examined time to progression from mild impairment to a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.

SETTING: Community volunteer-based sample examined at a medical institution.

PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and seven individuals who were cognitively normal and 235 individuals with mild cognitive impairment at baseline.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to progression from normal cognition to mild impairment and time to progression from mild impairment to a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.

RESULTS: The risk of progressing from normal to mild impairment was considerably greater among those with lower scores on tests of episodic memory (eg, hazard ratio for a 1-SD decrease in the California Verbal Learning Test, 0.55; P{\textless}.001). Normal individuals who carried at least 1 copy of the apolipoprotein E epsilon2 allele were less likely to develop cognitive impairments over time than individuals with no epsilon2 allele (hazard ratio for presence of allele, 0.13; P = .006). Measures of both episodic memory and executive function were significant predictors of time to progression from mild impairment to a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (eg, hazard ratio for a 1-SD decrease in California Verbal Learning Test score, 0.67; P = .005; hazard ratio for a 1-SD increase in the time to complete part B of the Trail Making test, 1.40; P = .007). Among individuals with mild impairments, the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele increased risk for Alzheimer disease in a dose-dependent manner; however, this effect was not significant within the context of multivariable models.

CONCLUSIONS: Episodic memory performance among normal individuals predicts time to progression to mild impairment while apolipoprotein E epsilon2 status is associated with lower risk of cognitive decline among normal individuals. Tests of both episodic memory and executive function are predictors of time to progression from mild impairment to a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {Identifying unusual growth-related measurements or longitudinal patterns in growth is often the focus in fetal and pediatric medicine. For example, the goal of the ongoing National Fetal Growth Study is to develop both cross-sectional and longitudinal reference curves for ultrasound fetal growth measurements that can be used for this purpose. Current methodology for estimating cross-sectional and longitudinal reference curves relies mainly on the linear mixed model. The focus of this paper is on examining the robustness of percentile estimation to the assumptions with respect to the Gaussian random-effect assumption implicitly made in the standard linear mixed model. We also examine a random-effects distribution based on mixtures of normals and compare the two approaches under both correct and misspecified random-effects distributions. In general, we find that the standard linear mixed model is relatively robust for cross-sectional percentile estimation but less robust for longitudinal or 'personalized' reference curves based on the conditional distribution given prior ultrasound measurements. The methodology is illustrated with data from a longitudinal fetal growth study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathological changes may arise up to 20 years before the onset of dementia. This pre-dementia window provides a unique opportunity for secondary prevention. However, exposing non-demented subjects to putative therapies requires reliable biomarkers for subject selection, stratification, and monitoring of treatment. Neuroimaging allows the detection of early pathological changes, and longitudinal imaging can assess the effect of interventions on markers of molecular pathology and rates of neurodegeneration. This is of particular importance in pre-dementia AD trials, where clinical outcomes have a limited ability to detect treatment effects within the typical time frame of a clinical trial. We review available evidence for the use of neuroimaging in clinical trials in pre-dementia AD. We appraise currently available imaging markers for subject selection, stratification, outcome measures, and safety in the context of such populations. MAIN BODY Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is a validated in-vivo marker of fibrillar amyloid plaques. It is appropriate for inclusion in trials targeting the amyloid pathway, as well as to monitor treatment target engagement. Amyloid PET, however, has limited ability to stage the disease and does not perform well as a prognostic marker within the time frame of a pre-dementia AD trial. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), providing markers of neurodegeneration, can improve the identification of subjects at risk of imminent decline and hence play a role in subject inclusion. Atrophy rates (either hippocampal or whole brain), which can be reliably derived from structural MRI, are useful in tracking disease progression and have the potential to serve as outcome measures. MRI can also be used to assess comorbid vascular pathology and define homogeneous groups for inclusion or for subject stratification. Finally, MRI also plays an important role in trial safety monitoring, particularly the identification of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Tau PET to measure neurofibrillary tangle burden is currently under development. Evidence to support the use of advanced MRI markers such as resting-state functional MRI, arterial spin labelling, and diffusion tensor imaging in pre-dementia AD is preliminary and requires further validation. CONCLUSION We propose a strategy for longitudinal imaging to track early signs of AD including quantitative amyloid PET and yearly multiparametric MRI.},

The procedure is based on off-line precomputations of $\alpha$-stable values on a grid of points in the $\alpha$-$\beta$ parameter space, as well as in a set of abscissa points. The grid is built by defining two quality measures and assuring that minimum values for these measures are reached on those points. Results indicate that the method here proposed is substantially faster than directly evaluating the standard expressions proposed by Nolan [1]. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to efficiently use estimation methods based on the evaluation of the PDF, such as the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle, which gives asymptotically unbiased and efficient estimates. To this end, an ML-based estimation algorithm is provided as well.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a rare leukodystrophy with no current treatment. rAAV-ASPA has been developed for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) for Canavan disease. This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder.

METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects.

RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation.

CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: When testing a hypothesis statistically, a principle is generally accepted that exact p values shall be stated in the treatise. Researchers have the choice of many statistical computer programmes with implemented hypothesis tests. Are exact p values calculated in the same statistical tests by diverse statistical programmes identical? METHODS: The respective zero hypothesis were tested in 5 artificially created data sets by the parametric unpaired t-test, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, two-tailed F-test. The calculations were carried out by the following programmes: Statistix, version 7.1 (source www.statistix.com), Analyse-it, version 1.62 (source www.analyse-it.com), MedCalc, version 6.14 (source www.medcalc.be). The p values in the same tests were mutually compared. RESULTS: All three programmes calculated identical exact p values for the t-test. In the remaining two tests in case of 26 out of 44 calculations (59.1 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval 43-73 per cent) different p values were calculated. The greatest difference was 18.35 per cent. In two cases the values oscillated about 0.05 and this fact caused essentially different interpretation of results. CONCLUSIONS: Using the significance test in the biomedical research has been subject to criticism for a longer period of time. The testing of the zero hypothesis on the arbitrary significance level of 0.05 should be substituted by other methods. Our discoveries should undermine the ungrounded belief of the users of statistical tests--physicians in ununderminable accuracy of mathematical procedures. The use of confidence intervals deems much more suitable although there are objections against them as well. (Tab. 4, Fig. 1, Ref. 19.).},

abstract = {The relationship between a primary endpoint and features of longitudinal profiles of a continuous response is often of interest, and a relevant framework is that of a generalized linear model with covariates that are subject-specific random effects in a linear mixed model for the longitudinal measurements. Naive implementation by imputing subject-specific effects from individual regression fits yields biased inference, and several methods for reducing this bias have been proposed. These require a parametric (normality) assumption on the random effects, which may be unrealistic. Adapting a strategy of Stefanski and Carroll (1987, Biometrika74, 703-716), we propose estimators for the generalized linear model parameters that require no assumptions on the random effects and yield consistent inference regardless of the true distribution. The methods are illustrated via simulation and by application to a study of bone mineral density in women transitioning to menopause.},

The present investigation was designed to test, in vivo, the efficacy of a preparation of rhNGF. Axons of cholinergic neurons of the BFMC in the rat were transected in the fimbria-fornix; this manipulation alters the phenotype and, eventually, causes retrograde degeneration of these neurons. Our investigation utilized two lesion paradigms (resection and partial transection of fibers in the fimbria-fornix), two different strains of rats, and two delivery systems. Following lesions, animals were allowed to survive for 2 weeks, during which time one group received intraventricular mouse NGF (mNGF), a second group received rhNGF, and a third group received vehicle alone. In animals receiving vehicle, there was a significant reduction in the number (resection: 70{\%}; transection: 50{\%}) and some reduction in size of choline acetyltransferase- or NGF receptor-immunoreactive cell bodies within the medial septal nucleus ipsilateral to the lesion. Treatment with either mNGF or rhNGF completely prevented these alterations in the number and size of cholinergic neurons. The rhNGF was shown to be equivalent in efficacy with mNGF. Thus, rhNGF is effective in preventing axotomy-induced degenerative changes in cholinergic neurons of the BFMC. Our results, taken together with the in vitro effects of rhNGF (42), indicate that an active rhNGF is now available for further in vivo studies in rodents and primates with experimentally induced or age-associated lesions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. These investigations provide essential information for the consideration of future utilization of rhNGF for treatment of human neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Pretest-posttest designs serve as building blocks for other more complicated repeated-measures designs. In settings where subjects are independent and errors follow a bivariate normal distribution, data analysis may consist of a univariate repeated-measures analysis or an analysis of covariance. Another possible analysis approach is to use seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The purpose of this article is to help guide the statistician toward an appropriate analysis choice. Assumptions, estimates, and test statistics for each analysis are approached in a systematic manner. On the basis of these results, the crucial choice of analysis is whether differences in pretest group means are conceived to be real or the result of pure measurement error. Direct consultation of the statistician with a subject-matter person is important in making the right choice. If pretest group differences are real, then a univariate repeated-measures analysis is recommended. If pretest group differences are the result of pure measurement error, then a conditional analysis or SUR analysis should be used. The conditional analysis and the SUR analysis will produce similar results. Smaller variance estimates can be expected based on the SUR analysis, but this gain is partially mediated by a lack of an exact distribution for test statistics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer was initiated in the early 1990s to evaluate the effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) testing on death rates from prostate cancer.

METHODS: We identified 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years through registries in seven European countries for inclusion in our study. The men were randomly assigned to a group that was offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or to a control group that did not receive such screening. The predefined core age group for this study included 162,243 men between the ages of 55 and 69 years. The primary outcome was the rate of death from prostate cancer. Mortality follow-up was identical for the two study groups and ended on December 31, 2006.

RESULTS: In the screening group, 82{\%} of men accepted at least one offer of screening. During a median follow-up of 9 years, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 8.2{\%} in the screening group and 4.8{\%} in the control group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group, as compared with the control group, was 0.80 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.04). The absolute risk difference was 0.71 death per 1000 men. This means that 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated to prevent one death from prostate cancer. The analysis of men who were actually screened during the first round (excluding subjects with noncompliance) provided a rate ratio for death from prostate cancer of 0.73 (95{\%} CI, 0.56 to 0.90).

CONCLUSIONS: PSA-based screening reduced the rate of death from prostate cancer by 20{\%} but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN49127736.)},

A statistical model with a simple regression structure for the mean trajectory of the longitudinal data and a two-parameter model for the correlations of within-individual observations given by corr(yt,yt+s) = gamma s theta is used. The methods are illustrated by considering a two-group trial and investigating the effect of different values of the correlation parameters, gamma and theta on the sample size.

abstract = {Little research has been conducted on the statistical properties of composite measures comprising linear combinations of continuous component scales. We assessed the quantitative relationship between the composites and their individual components regarding their abilities to detect treatment effects. In particular, we developed the mathematical derivation of the treatment effect size of a continuous composite in relation to the treatment effect sizes of its components and proved multiple properties of the composite. We demonstrated that the treatment effect size of a composite is greater than the minimum treatment effect size of its components and that above certain thresholds of correlations of components and ratios of component effect sizes, the composite may outperform its components. Examples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical studies of solanezumab and donepezil using the composite Integrated AD Rating Scale (iADRS) and its components, the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living inventory, instrumental items (ADCS-iADL) were consistent with the theoretical statistical properties. The understanding of the quantitative relationships between continuous composites and their components will be useful in clinical trial design and the development of new scales and composites across therapeutic areas.},

abstract = {Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a nonparametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously. We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple data sets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10{\%} to 30{\%}. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in data sets including different types of variables. In our comparative study missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and nonlinear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.},

abstract = {Existing methods for power analysis for longitudinal study designs are limited in that they do not adequately address random missing data patterns. Although the pattern of missing data can be assessed during data analysis, it is unknown during the design phase of a study. The random nature of the missing data pattern adds another layer of complexity in addressing missing data for power analysis. In this paper, we model the occurrence of missing data with a two-state, first-order Markov process and integrate the modelling information into the power function to account for random missing data patterns. The Markov model is easily specified to accommodate different anticipated missing data processes. We develop this approach for the two most popular longitudinal models: the generalized estimating equations (GEE) and the linear mixed-effects model under the missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption. For GEE, we also limit our consideration to the working independence correlation model. The proposed methodology is illustrated with numerous examples that are motivated by real study designs.},

abstract = {Background: Fibrillar amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) is thought to begin accumulating in the brain many years before the onset of clinical impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease. By assessing the accumulation of A$\beta$ in people at risk of genetic forms of Alzheimer's disease, we can identify how early preclinical changes start in individuals certain to develop dementia later in life. We sought to characterise the age-related accumulation of A$\beta$ deposition in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers across the spectrum of preclinical disease. Methods: Between Aug 1 and Dec 6, 2011, members of the familial Alzheimer's disease Colombian kindred aged 18-60 years were recruited from the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative's registry at the University of Antioquia, Medell{\'{i}}n, Colombia. Cross-sectional assessment using florbetapir PET was done in symptomatic mutation carriers with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, asymptomatic carriers, and asymptomatic non-carriers. These assessments were done at the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, AZ, USA. A cortical grey matter mask consisting of six predefined regions was used to measure mean cortical florbetapir PET binding. Cortical-to-pontine standard-uptake value ratios were used to characterise the cross-sectional accumulation of fibrillar A$\beta$ deposition in carriers and non-carriers with regression analysis and to estimate the trajectories of fibrillar A$\beta$ deposition. Findings: We enrolled a cohort of 11 symptomatic individuals, 19 presymptomatic mutation carriers, and 20 asymptomatic non-carriers, ranging in age from 20 to 56 years. There was greater florbetapir binding in asymptomatic PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers than in age matched non-carriers. Fibrillar A$\beta$ began to accumulate in PSEN 1E280A mutation carriers at a mean age of 28{\textperiodcentered}2 years (95{\%} CI 27{\textperiodcentered}3-33{\textperiodcentered}4), about 16 years and 21 years before the predicted median ages at mild cognitive impairment and dementia onset, respectively.18F florbetapir binding rose steeply over the next 9{\textperiodcentered}4 years and plateaued at a mean age of 37{\textperiodcentered}6 years (95{\%} CI 35{\textperiodcentered}3-40{\textperiodcentered}2), about 6 and 11 years before the expected respective median ages at mild cognitive impairment and dementia onset. Prominent florbetapir binding was seen in the anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus, and parietotemporal and frontal grey matter, as well as in the basal ganglia. Binding in the basal ganglia was not seen earlier or more prominently than in other regions. Interpretation: These findings contribute to the understanding of preclinical familial Alzheimer's disease and help set the stage for assessment of amyloid-modifying treatments in the prevention of familial Alzheimer's disease.

@article{Kernan1999a,
abstract = {Trialists argue about the usefulness of stratified randomization. For investigators designing trials and readers who use them, the argument has created uncertainty regarding the importance of stratification. In this paper, we review stratified randomization to summarize its purpose, indications, accomplishments, and alternatives. In order to identify research papers, we performed a Medline search for 1966-1997. The search yielded 33 articles that included original research on stratification or included stratification as the major focus. Additional resources included textbooks. Stratified randomization prevents imbalance between treatment groups for known factors that influence prognosis or treatment responsiveness. As a result, stratification may prevent type I error and improve power for small trials ({\textless}400 patients), but only when the stratification factors have a large effect on prognosis. Stratification has an important effect on sample size for active control equivalence trials, but not for superiority trials. Theoretical benefits include facilitation of subgroup analysis and interim analysis. The maximum desirable number of strata is unknown, but experts argue for keeping it small. Stratified randomization is important only for small trials in which treatment outcome may be affected by known clinical factors that have a large effect on prognosis, large trials when interim analyses are planned with small numbers of patients, and trials designed to show the equivalence of two therapies. Once the decision to stratify is made, investigators need to chose factors carefully and account for them in the analysis.},

abstract = {The objective of the present study was to evaluate a Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS) and rough set Rosetta pipeline for generating rule-based models as a tool for comprehensive risk estimates for future Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individual patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Risk estimates were generated on the basis of age, gender, Mini-Mental State Examination scores, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers total tau (T-tau), phospho-tau(181) (P-tau) and the 42 amino acid form of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$42) in two sets of longitudinally followed MCI patients (n = 217 in total). The predictive model was created in Rosetta, evaluated with the standard tenfold cross-validation approach and tested on an external set. Features were ranked and selected by the MCFS algorithm. Using the combined pipeline of MCFS and Rosetta, it was possible to predict AD among patients with MCI with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.92. Risk estimates were produced for the individual patients and showed good correlation with actual diagnosis in cross validation, and on an external dataset from a new study. Analysis of the importance of attributes showed that the biochemical CSF markers contributed the most to the predictions, and that added value was gained by combining several biochemical markers. Despite a correlation with the biochemical markers, the genetic marker APOE $\epsilon$4 did not contribute to the predictive power of the model.},

We report on the design of an exploratory longitudinal MRI follow-up study that was performed in a subgroup of the PERFORM trial. An international multi-centre longitudinal follow-up MRI study was designed for different MR systems employing safety and efficacy readouts: new T2 lesions, new DWI lesions, whole brain volume change, hippocampal volume change, changes in tissue microstructure as depicted by mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, vessel patency on MR angiography, and the presence of and development of new microbleeds. A total of 1,056 patients (men and women ≥ 55 years) were included. The data analysis included 3D reformation, image registration of different contrasts, tissue segmentation, and automated lesion detection. This large international multi-centre study demonstrates how new MRI readouts can be used to provide key information on the evolution of cerebral tissue lesions and within the macrovasculature after atherothrombotic stroke in a large sample of patients.},

abstract = {In multicentre trials, randomisation is often carried out using permuted blocks stratified by centre. It has previously been shown that stratification variables used in the randomisation process should be adjusted for in the analysis to obtain correct inference. For continuous outcomes, the two primary methods of accounting for centres are fixed-effects and random-effects models. We discuss the differences in interpretation between these two models and the implications that each pose for analysis. We then perform a large simulation study comparing the performance of these analysis methods in a variety of situations. In total, we assessed 378 scenarios. We found that random centre effects performed as well or better than fixed-effects models in all scenarios. Random centre effects models led to increases in power and precision when the number of patients per centre was small (e.g. 10 patients or less) and, in some scenarios, when there was an imbalance between treatments within centres, either due to the randomisation method or to the distribution of patients across centres. With small samples sizes, random-effects models maintained nominal coverage rates when a degree-of-freedom (DF) correction was used. We assessed the robustness of random-effects models when assumptions regarding the distribution of the centre effects were incorrect and found this had no impact on results. We conclude that random-effects models offer many advantages over fixed-effects models in certain situations and should be used more often in practice.},

@article{Raghavan2013b,
abstract = {Background: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) has been used widely as a cognitive end point in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) clinical trials. Efforts to treat AD pathology at earlier stages have also used ADAS-Cog, but failure in these trials can be difficult to interpret because the scale has well-known ceiling effects that limit its use in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. A wealth of data exists in ADAS-Cog from both historical trials and contemporary longitudinal natural history studies that can provide insights about parts of the scale that may be better suited for MCI and early AD trials. Methods: Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study data, we identified the most informative cognitive measures from the ADAS-Cog and other available scales. We used cross-sectional analyses to characterize trajectories of ADAS-Cog and its individual subscales, as well as other cognitive, functional, or global measures across disease stages. Informative measures were identified based on standardized mean of 2-year change from baseline and were combined into novel composite endpoints. We assessed performance of the novel endpoints based on sample size requirements for a 2-year clinical trial. A bootstrap validation procedure was also undertaken to assess the reproducibility of the standardized mean changes of the selected measures and the corresponding composites. Results: All proposed novel endpoints have improved standardized mean changes and thus improved statistical power compared with the ADAS-Cog 11. Further improvements were achieved by using cognitive-functional composites. Combining the novel composites with an enrichment strategy based on cerebral spinal fluid beta-amyloid (A$\beta$1-42) in a 2-year trial yielded gains in power of 20{\%} to 40{\%} over ADAS-Cog 11, regardless of the novel measure considered. Conclusion: An empirical, data-driven approach with e xisting instruments was used to derive novel composite scales based on ADAS-Cog 11 with improved performance characteristics for MCI and early AD clinical trials. Together with patient enrichment based on A$\beta$1-42pathology, these modified endpoints may allow more efficient clinical trials in these populations and can be assessed without modifying current test administration procedures in ongoing trials. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Alzheimer's Association.

The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

abstract = {Computational anatomy with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well established as a noninvasive biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, there is less certainty about its dependency on the staging of AD. We use classical group analyses and automated machine learning classification of standard structural MRI scans to investigate AD diagnostic accuracy from the preclinical phase to clinical dementia. Longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were stratified into 4 groups according to the clinical status-(1) AD patients; (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converters; (3) MCI nonconverters; and (4) healthy controls-and submitted to a support vector machine. The obtained classifier was significantly above the chance level (62{\%}) for detecting AD already 4 years before conversion from MCI. Voxel-based univariate tests confirmed the plausibility of our findings detecting a distributed network of hippocampal-temporoparietal atrophy in AD patients. We also identified a subgroup of control subjects with brain structure and cognitive changes highly similar to those observed in AD. Our results indicate that computational anatomy can detect AD substantially earlier than suggested by current models. The demonstrated differential spatial pattern of atrophy between correctly and incorrectly classified AD patients challenges the assumption of a uniform pathophysiological process underlying clinically identified AD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Patterns of dementia are known to fall into dissociated but dispersed brain networks, suggesting that the disease is transmitted along neuronal pathways rather than by proximity. This view is supported by neuropathological evidence for "prion-like" transsynaptic transmission of disease agents like misfolded tau and beta amyloid. We mathematically model this transmission by a diffusive mechanism mediated by the brain's connectivity network obtained from tractography of 14 healthy-brain MRIs. Subsequent graph theoretic analysis provides a fully quantitative, testable, predictive model of dementia. Specifically, we predict spatially distinct "persistent modes," which, we found, recapitulate known patterns of dementia and match recent reports of selectively vulnerable dissociated brain networks. Model predictions also closely match T1-weighted MRI volumetrics of 18 Alzheimer's and 18 frontotemporal dementia subjects. Prevalence rates predicted by the model strongly agree with published data. This work has many important implications, including dimensionality reduction, differential diagnosis, and especially prediction of future atrophy using baseline MRI morphometrics.},

It happens when unusually large or small measurements tend to be followed by measurements that are closer to the mean. METHODS: We give some examples of the phenomenon, and discuss methods to overcome it at the design and analysis stages of a study. RESULTS: The effect of RTM in a sample becomes more noticeable with increasing measurement error and when follow-up measurements are only examined on a sub-sample selected using a baseline value. CONCLUSIONS: RTM is a ubiquitous phenomenon in repeated data and should always be considered as a possible cause of an observed change. Its effect can be alleviated through better study design and use of suitable statistical methods.},

abstract = {Abstract Multicentre studies are common in epidemiological research aiming at identifying disease risk factors. A major advantage of multicentre over single-centre studies is that, by including a larger number of participants, they allow consideration of rare outcomes and exposures. Their multicentric nature introduces some complexities at the step of data analysis, in particular when it comes to controlling for confounding by centre, which is the focus of this tutorial. Commonly, epidemiologists use one of the following options: pooling all centre-specific data and adjusting for centre using fixed effects; adjusting for centre using random effects; or fitting centre-specific models and combining the results in a meta-analysis. Here, we illustrate the similarities of and differences between these three modelling approaches, explain the reasons why they may provide different conclusions and offer advice on which model to choose depending on the characteristics of the study. Two key issues to examine during the analyses are to distinguish within-centre from between-centre associations, and the possible heterogeneity of the effects (of exposure and/or confounders) by centre. A real epidemiological study is used to illustrate a situation in which these various options yield different results. A synthetic dataset and R and Stata codes are provided to reproduce the results.},

However, most completed trials have failed to demonstrate efficacy, and there is growing concern that methodologic difficulties may contribute to these clinical trial failures. The optimal time to intervene with such treatments is probably in the years prior to the onset of dementia, before the neuropathology has progressed to the advanced stage corresponding to clinical dementia.

METHOD: An international task force of individuals from academia, industry, nonprofit foundations, and regulatory agencies was convened to discuss optimal trial design in early (predementia) AD.

RESULTS: General consensus was reached on key principles involving the scope of the AD diagnosis, the selection of subjects for trials, outcome measures, and analytical methods.

CONCLUSION: A consensus has been achieved in support of the testing of candidate treatments in the early (predementia) AD population.},

Despite approval of several drugs for AD, the disease continues to rob millions of their memories and their lives. Fortunately, many new therapies directly targeting the mechanisms underlying AD are now in the pipeline. Among the investigative AD therapies in clinical trials are several strategies to block pathogenic amyloid-beta peptides and to rescue vulnerable neurons from degeneration. Complementary but less mature strategies aim to prevent the copathogenic effects of apolipoprotein E and the microtubule-associated protein tau. New insights into selective neuronal vulnerability and the link between aging and AD may provide additional entry points for therapeutic interventions. The predicted increase in AD cases over the next few decades makes the development of better treatments a matter of utmost importance and urgency.},

Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set, properties of the 11-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.11), the 13-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.All) and novel composite scores were compared, using weighting schemes derived from the Random Forests (RF) tree-based multivariate model. Weighting subscores using the RF model of ADAS.All enhanced discrimination between elderly controls, MCI and AD patients. The ability of the RF-weighted ADAS-cog composite and individual scores, along with neuroimaging or biochemical biomarkers to predict MCI to AD conversion over 12 months was also assessed. Although originally optimized to discriminate across diagnostic categories, the ADAS. All, weighted according to the RF model, did nearly as well or better than individual or composite baseline neuroimaging or CSF biomarkers in prediction of 12-month conversion from MCI to AD. These suggest that a modified subscore weighting scheme applied to the 13-item ADAS-cog is comparable to imaging or CSF markers in prediction of conversion from MCI to AD at 12 months.},

Bapineuzumab or placebo, with doses varying by study, was administered by intravenous infusion every 13 weeks for 78 weeks. The primary outcome measures were scores on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11, with scores ranging from 0 to 70 and higher scores indicating greater impairment) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD, with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating less impairment). A total of 1090 carriers and 1114 noncarriers were included in the efficacy analysis. Secondary outcome measures included findings on positron-emission tomographic amyloid imaging with the use of Pittsburgh compound B (PIB-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau) concentrations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcomes. At week 78, the between-group differences in the change from baseline in the ADAS-cog11 and DAD scores (bapineuzumab group minus placebo group) were -0.2 (P=0.80) and -1.2 (P=0.34), respectively, in the carrier study; the corresponding differences in the noncarrier study were -0.3 (P=0.64) and 2.8 (P=0.07) with the 0.5-mg-per-kilogram dose of bapineuzumab and 0.4 (P=0.62) and 0.9 (P=0.55) with the 1.0-mg-per-kilogram dose. The major safety finding was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema among patients receiving bapineuzumab, which increased with bapineuzumab dose and APOE $\epsilon$4 allele number and which led to discontinuation of the 2.0-mg-per-kilogram dose. Between-group differences were observed with respect to PIB-PET and cerebrospinal fluid phospho-tau concentrations in APOE $\epsilon$4 allele carriers but not in noncarriers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with Alzheimer's disease, despite treatment differences in biomarkers observed in APOE $\epsilon$4 carriers.

METHODS In a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 390 participants with mild to moderate AD to receive placebo (low-dose albumin) or IVIg (Gammagard Liquid; Baxalta, Bannockburn, IL) administered IV at doses of 0.2 or 0.4 g/kg every 2 weeks for 18 months. The primary cognitive outcome was change from baseline to 18 months on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale; the primary functional outcome was 18-month change on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory. Safety and tolerability data, as well as serial MRIs and plasma samples, were collected throughout the study from all enrolled participants. RESULTS No beneficial effects were observed in the dual primary outcome measures for the 2 IVIg doses tested. Significant decreases in plasma A$\beta$42 (but not A$\beta$40) levels were observed in IVIg-treated participants. Analysis of safety data showed no difference between IVIg and placebo in terms of the rate of occurrence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (brain edema or microhemorrhage). IVIg-treated participants had more systemic reactions (chills, rashes) but fewer respiratory infections than participants receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS Participants with mild to moderate AD showed good tolerability of treatment with low-dose human IVIg for 18 months but did not show beneficial effects on cognition or function relative to participants who received placebo. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER NCT00818662.

abstract = {The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unknown. In addition, this terrible neurodegenerative disease will increase exponentially over the next two decades due to longer lifespan and an aging "baby-boomer" generation. All treatments currently approved for AD have moderate efficacy in slowing the rate of cognitive decline in patients, and no efficacy in halting progression of the disease. Hence, there is an urgent need for new drug targets and delivery methods to slow or reverse the progression of AD. One molecule that has received much attention in its potential therapeutic role in AD is nerve growth factor (NGF). This review will demonstrate data from humans and animals which promote NGF as a potential therapeutic target by (1) outlining the hypothesis behind using NGF for the treatment of AD, (2) reviewing both the normal and AD altered signaling pathways and effects of NGF in the central nervous system (CNS), and (3) examining the results of NGF treatment obtained from animal models of AD and AD patients.},

The Task Force discussed challenges that need to be addressed across all aspects of clinical trials, calling for innovation in recruitment and retention, infrastructure development, and the selection of outcome measures. While cognitive change provides a marker of disease progression across the disease continuum, there remains a need to identify the optimal assessment tools that provide clinically meaningful endpoints. Patient- and informant-reported assessments of cognition and function may be useful but present additional challenges.

Here we present a new machine learning technique - Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) - able to uncover data-driven disease phenotypes with distinct temporal progression patterns, from widely available cross-sectional patient studies. Results from imaging studies in two neurodegenerative diseases reveal new subgroups and their distinct trajectories of regional neurodegeneration. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, SuStaIn identifies genotypes from imaging alone, validating its ability to identify subtypes, and characterises within-group heterogeneity for the first time. In Alzheimer's disease, SuStaIn uncovers three subtypes, uniquely revealing their temporal complexity. SuStaIn provides fine-grained patient stratification, which substantially enhances the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories over standard models that ignore subtype (p=7.18×10-4) or temporal stage (p=3.96×10-5). SuStaIn thus offers new promise for enabling disease subtype discovery and precision medicine.},

abstract = {The simplest expression of episodic memory is the experience of familiarity, the isolated recognition that something has been encountered previously. Brain structures of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) make essential contributions to episodic memory, but the distinct contributions from each MTL structure to familiarity are debatable. Here we used specialized tests to assess recognition impairments and their relationship to MTL integrity in people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n=19), people with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD; n=10), and age-matched individuals without any neurological disorder (n=20). Recognition of previously presented silhouette objects was tested in two formats-forced-choice recognition with four concurrent choices (one target and three foils) and yes/no recognition with individually presented targets and foils. Every foil was extremely similar to a corresponding target, such that forced-choice recognition could be based on differential familiarity among the choices, whereas yes/no recognition necessitated additional memory and decision factors. Only yes/no recognition was impaired in the aMCI group, whereas both forced-choice and yes/no recognition were impaired in the AD group. Magnetic resonance imaging showed differential brain atrophy, as MTL volume was reduced in the AD group but not in the aMCI group. Pulsed arterial spin-labeled scans demonstrated that MTL blood flow was abnormally increased in aMCI, which could indicate physiological dysfunction prior to the emergence of significant atrophy. Regression analyses with data from all patients revealed that regional patterns of MTL integrity were differentially related to forced-choice and yes/no recognition. Smaller perirhinal cortex volume was associated with lower forced-choice recognition accuracy, but not with lower yes/no recognition accuracy. Instead, smaller hippocampal volumes were associated with lower yes/no recognition accuracy. In sum, familiarity memory can be specifically assessed using the forced-choice recognition test, it declines later than other MTL-dependent memory functions as AD progresses, and it has distinct anatomical substrates.},

After parallel groups complete the first period, treatment is either initiated or withdrawn in the second period in a subset of subjects. The purpose of the second period is to provide evidence of whether any effect of treatment observed during the first period is long-term ("disease-modifying") or short-term and transitory ("symptomatic"). A four-arm version, which we term a complete two-period design, has active/active, active/placebo, placebo/active and placebo/placebo respective treatment assignments in the two periods. We provide statistical models for these designs, describe some of the appropriate analyses, and investigate the relative efficiencies of various allocations and special cases. We describe extensions to full and partial factorial versions of such designs which permit efficient and simultaneous evaluation of disease-modifying and symptomatic effects of two or more treatments, along with possible interactions. Advantages and limitations of the various designs are discussed.},

abstract = {Objective. To assess the impact, in terms of statistical power and bias of treatment effect, of approaches to dealing with missing data in randomized controlled trials of rheumatoid arthritis with radiographic outcomes. Methods. We performed a simulation study. The missingness mechanisms we investigated copied the process of withdrawal from trials due to lack of efficacy. We compared 3 methods of managing missing data: all available data (case-complete), last observation carried forward (LOCF), and multiple imputation. Data were then analyzed by classic t-test (comparing the mean absolute change between baseline and final visit) or F test (estimation of treatment effect with repeated measurements by a linear mixed-effects model). Results. With a missing data rate close to 15{\%}, the treatment effect was underestimated by 18{\%} as estimated by a linear mixed-effects model with a multiple imputation approach to missing data. This bias was lower than that obtained with the case-complete approach (-25{\%}) or LOCF approach (-35{\%}). This statistical approach (combination of multiple imputation and mixed-effects analysis) was moreover associated with a power of 70{\%} (for a 90{\%} nominal level), whereas LOCF was associated with a power of 55{\%} and a case-complete power of 58{\%}. Analysis with the t-test gave qualitatively equivalent but poorer quality results, except when multiple imputation was applied. Conclusion. Our simulation study demonstrated multiple imputation, offering the smallest bias in treatment effect and the highest power. These results can help in planning trials, especially in choosing methods of imputation and data analysis. {\textcopyright} 2008, American College of Rheumatology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1 (ADNI-1) is a multisite prospective study designed to examine potential cerebrospinal fluid and imaging markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their relationship to cognitive change. The objective of this study was to provide a global summary of the overall results and patterns of change observed in candidate markers and clinical measures over the first 2 years of follow-up.

METHODS: Change was summarized for 210 normal controls, 357 mild cognitive impairment, and 162 AD subjects, with baseline and at least one cognitive follow-up assessment. Repeated measures and survival models were used to assess baseline biomarker levels as predictors. Potential for improving clinical trials was assessed by comparison of precision of markers for capturing change in hypothetical trial designs.

RESULTS: The first 12 months of complete data on ADNI participants demonstrated the potential for substantial advances in characterizing trajectories of change in a range of biomarkers and clinical outcomes, examining their relationship and timing, and assessing the potential for improvements in clinical trial design. Reduced metabolism and greater brain atrophy in the mild cognitive impairment at baseline are associated with more rapid cognitive decline and a higher rate of conversion to AD. Use of biomarkers as study entry criteria or as outcomes could reduce the number of participants required for clinical trials.

CONCLUSIONS: Analyses and comparisons of ADNI data strongly support the hypothesis that measurable change occurs in cerebrospinal fluid, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging well in advance of the actual diagnosis of AD.},

abstract = {Identification and reporting of adverse events is an important responsibility of investigators conducting clinical trials of new pharmaceutical compounds. We have designed and implemented a computerized data management system for clinical trials data and have evaluated its performance in managing adverse event information from clinical studies. All cases in which adverse event occurred and a random sample of cases without adverse events were selected from two clinical trials managed with the new computerized system and compared with identically selected cases from two clinical trials managed with the paper system. Rates of transcription errors, data selection errors and failure to identify adverse events were examined by logistic regression. Analysis of variance of the time required to evaluate clinical information or report adverse events to sponsors was also conducted. Implementation of the computer system resulted in significantly fewer errors in data transcription (17{\%} vs 0{\%}; P less than 0.001) and fewer cases in which adverse events were overlooked (35{\%} vs 3{\%}; P less than 0.001). However, data selection errors were more common using the computer system (2{\%} vs 8{\%}; P = 0.03) because the items evaluated were transferred electronically, rather than selected for appropriateness by a clinician. The average time required to evaluate clinical information and to report adverse event information to sponsoring agencies has been reduced by 2-4 months (P less than 0.001) depending on the severity of the event. This reduction has improved compliance with federal regulations governing the responsibilities of clinical investigators. It has also permitted early identification of toxicities and appropriate amendment of research protocols, thus reducing risk to patients enrolled in clinical trials.},

abstract = {A 2×2 table may arise from three types of sampling, depending on the number of previously fixed marginals, and may yield three possible, differing, probabilistic models. From the unconditional point of view each model requires a specific solution but, within each model, the calculation time increases as the test procedure chosen is more powerful and, between the models, the calculation time decreases in the number of marginals fixed. Moreover, each model yields a test which is generally more powerful than the test of any other model with a larger number of marginals fixed. The condition under which a less powerful test, of the same or a different model, can substitute a more powerful test with a loss of power lower than 2{\%} is determined. It is concluded that the Fisher exact test can be used as an approximation to Barnard's exact test for a table with 0 or 1 fixed marginals, when the sample size is ≥100 or when the smaller sample size is ≥80, respectively. Similarly, Barnard's exact test for a table with 1 fixed marginal can be used as an approximation of the same test for a table with 0 fixed marginals, when the sample size is ≥50. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The confirmatory analysis of pre-specified multiple hypotheses has become common in pivotal clinical trials. In the recent past multiple test procedures have been developed that reflect the relative importance of different study objectives, such as fixed sequence, fallback, and gatekeeping procedures. In addition, graphical approaches have been proposed that facilitate the visualization and communication of Bonferroni-based closed test procedures for common multiple test problems, such as comparing several treatments with a control, assessing the benefit of a new drug for more than one endpoint, combined non-inferiority and superiority testing, or testing a treatment at different dose levels in an overall and a subpopulation. In this paper, we focus on extended graphical approaches by dissociating the underlying weighting strategy from the employed test procedure. This allows one to first derive suitable weighting strategies that reflect the given study objectives and subsequently apply appropriate test procedures, such as weighted Bonferroni tests, weighted parametric tests accounting for the correlation between the test statistics, or weighted Simes tests. We illustrate the extended graphical approaches with several examples. In addition, we describe briefly the gMCP package in R, which implements some of the methods described in this paper.},

Both principles involve a directional bias that is related to the direction of baseline difference and the direction of the hypothesized difference in change.

@article{Vickers2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sharing of raw research data is common in many areas of medical research, genomics being perhaps the most well-known example. In the clinical trial community investigators routinely refuse to share raw data from a randomized trial without giving a reason. DISCUSSION: Data sharing benefits numerous research-related activities: reproducing analyses; testing secondary hypotheses; developing and evaluating novel statistical methods; teaching; aiding design of future trials; meta-analysis; and, possibly, preventing error, fraud and selective reporting. Clinical trialists, however, sometimes appear overly concerned with being scooped and with misrepresentation of their work. Both possibilities can be avoided with simple measures such as inclusion of the original trialists as co-authors on any publication resulting from data sharing. Moreover, if we treat any data set as belonging to the patients who comprise it, rather than the investigators, such concerns fall away. CONCLUSION: Technological developments, particularly the Internet, have made data sharing generally a trivial logistical problem. Data sharing should come to be seen as an inherent part of conducting a randomized trial, similar to the way in which we consider ethical review and publication of study results. Journals and funding bodies should insist that trialists make raw data available, for example, by publishing data on the Web. If the clinical trial community continues to fail with respect to data sharing, we will only strengthen the public perception that we do clinical trials to benefit ourselves, not our patients.},

However, its advantage over t-tests can be nullified by small numbers of patients, violations of assumptions, and incorrect application of the techniques.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and amyloid beta (Abeta) response to the gamma-secretase inhibitor LY450139 in Alzheimer disease.

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled trial.

SETTING: Community-based clinical research centers. Patients Fifty-one individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease were randomized to receive placebo (n=15) or LY450139 (100 mg [n=22] or 140 mg [n=14]), with 43 completing the treatment phase. Intervention The LY450139 groups received 60 mg/d for 2 weeks, then 100 mg/d for 6 weeks, and then either 100 or 140 mg/d for 6 additional weeks.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were adverse events, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid Abeta levels, vital signs, electrocardiographic data, and laboratory safety test results. Secondary outcome measures included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Scale.

RESULTS: Group differences were seen in skin and subcutaneous tissue concerns (P=.05), including 3 possible drug rashes and 3 reports of hair color change in the treatment groups. There were 3 adverse event-related discontinuations, including 1 transient bowel obstruction. The plasma Abeta(40) concentration was reduced by 58.2{\%} for the 100-mg group and 64.6{\%} for the 140-mg group (P{\textless}.001). No significant reduction was seen in cerebrospinal fluid Abeta levels. No group differences were seen in cognitive or functional measures.

CONCLUSIONS: LY450139 was generally well tolerated at doses of up to 140 mg/d for 14 weeks, with several findings indicating the need for close clinical monitoring in future studies. Decreases in plasma Abeta concentrations were consistent with inhibition of gamma-secretase. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00244322.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the slow and variable clinical course of Alzheimer disease, very large and extended clinical trials are needed to identify a beneficial clinical effect of disease-modifying treatments. Therefore, biomarkers are essential to prove that an anti-$\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) drug candidate affects both A$\beta$ metabolism and plaque load as well as downstream pathogenic mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the anti-A$\beta$ monoclonal antibody bapineuzumab on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers reflecting A$\beta$ homeostasis, neuronal degeneration, and tau-related pathology in patients with Alzheimer disease.

DESIGN: Two phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12-month duration.

SETTING: Academic centers in the United States (Study 201) and England and Finland (Study 202).

PATIENTS: Forty-six patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either placebo (n = 19) or bapineuzumab (n = 27) in 3 or 4 ascending dose groups.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes between end of study and baseline in the exploratory CSF biomarkers A$\beta$1-42, A$\beta$X-42, A$\beta$X-40; total tau (T-tau); and phosphorylated tau (P-tau).

RESULTS: Within the bapineuzumab group, a decrease at end of study compared with baseline was found both for CSF T-tau (-72.3 pg/mL) and P-tau (-9.9 pg/mL). When comparing the treatment and placebo groups, this difference was statistically significant for P-tau (P = .03), while a similar trend for a decrease was found for T-tau (P = .09). No clear-cut differences were observed for CSF A$\beta$.

CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that passive A$\beta$ immunotherapy with bapineuzumab results in decreases in CSF T-tau and P-tau, which may indicate downstream effects on the degenerative process. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may be useful to monitor the effects of novel disease-modifying anti-A$\beta$ drugs in clinical trials.

Informants were queried regarding functional impairments. Some participants had lumbar punctures to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We added executive functioning (EF) and functional ability (FA) items to the ADAS-Cog to generate candidate augmented measures. We calibrated these candidates using baseline data (n = 811) and selected the best candidate that added EF items alone and that added EF and FA items. We selected candidates based on their responsiveness over three years in a training sample of participants with MCI (n = 160). We compared traditional ADAS-Cog scores with the two candidates based on their responsiveness in a validation sample of participants with MCI (n = 234), ability to predict conversion to dementia (n = 394), strength of association with baseline MRI (n = 394) and CSF biomarkers (n = 193).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The selected EF candidate added category fluency (ADAS Plus EF), and the selected EF and FA candidate added category fluency, Digit Symbol, Trail Making, and five items from the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (ADAS Plus EF{\&}FA).

abstract = {Intracerebral grafts consisting of primary fibroblasts genetically engineered to express NGF were used to assess the regenerative capacity of cholinergic neurons of the adult rat septum. Our data reveal that NGF-producing grafts sustain a significantly higher proportion of NGF receptor-immunoreactive septal neurons following axotomy (approximately 65-75{\%}) than do grafts of noninfected fibroblasts. In addition, NGF promotes the regeneration of septal axons. Following the ablation of cholinergic septal projections to the hippocampus, NGF-producing grafts placed within the lesion cavity contain large numbers of AChE-positive axons; control grafts, on the other hand, lack such cholinergic axons. Ultrastructural examination reveals that unmyelinated axons within NGF-producing grafts use many different substrates for growth, including astrocytes and components of the extracellular matrix. Grafts of control fibroblasts possess the same cellular and matrix substrates but contain only a small population of axons, probably of peripheral origin. AChE-positive axons growing through NGF-producing grafts provide a new topographically organized input to the deafferented hippocampal dentate gyrus. Furthermore, regenerating septal axons terminate predominantly on the dendritic processes of granular neurons. The dentate gyrus ipsilateral to grafts of noninfected fibroblasts, on the other hand, remains devoid of AChE-positive fibers. From these results, we conclude that the availability of NGF is a necessary requirement to sustain axotomized cholinergic septal neurons and to promote axon regeneration and cholinergic reinnervation of dentate granular neurons by these lesioned neurons. The presence of many permissive substrates (e.g., astrocytes, basal lamina, and collagen) alone, however, is not sufficient to induce axon regrowth from adult septal neurons.},

abstract = {Since the first description of the case of Auguste Deter, presented in T{\"{u}}bingen in 1906 by Alois Alzheimer, there has been an exponential increase in our knowledge of the neuropathological, cellular, and molecular foundation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The concept of AD pathogenesis has evolved from a static, binary view discriminating cognitive normality from dementia, towards a dynamic view that considers AD pathology as a long-lasting morbid process that takes place progressively over years, or even decades, before the first symptoms become apparent, and thus operating in a continuum between the two aforementioned extreme states. Several biomarkers have been proposed to predict AD-related cognitive decline, initially in cases with mild cognitive impairment, and more recently in cognitively intact individuals. These early markers define at-risk individuals thought to be in the preclinical phase of AD. However, the clinical relevance of this preclinical phase remains controversial. The fate of such individuals, who are cognitively intact, but positive for some early AD biomarkers, is currently uncertain at best. In this report, we advocate the point of view that although most of these preclinical cases will evolve to clinically overt AD, some appear to have efficient compensatory mechanisms and virtually never develop dementia. We critically review the currently available early AD markers, discuss their clinical relevance, and propose a novel classification of preclinical AD, designating these non-progressing cases as 'stable asymptomatic cerebral amyloidosis'.},

abstract = {Introduction: Treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed due to the growing number of individuals with preclinical, prodromal, and dementia forms of AD. Drug development for AD therapies can be examined by inspecting the drug development pipeline as represented on clinicaltrials.gov. Methods: Clinicaltrials.gov was assessed as of January 30, 2018 to determine AD therapies represented in phase I, phase II, and phase III. Results: There are 112 agents in the current AD treatment pipeline. There are 26 agents in 35 trials in phase III, 63 agents in 75 trials in phase II, and 23 agents in 25 trials in phase I. A review of the mechanisms of actions of the agents in the pipeline shows that 63{\%} are disease-modifying therapies, 22{\%} are symptomatic cognitive enhancers, and 12{\%} are symptomatic agents addressing neuropsychiatric and behavioral changes. Trials in phase III are larger and longer than phase II or phase I trials, particularly those involving disease-modifying agents. Comparison with the 2017 pipeline shows that there are four new agents in phase III, 14 in phase II, and eight in phase I. Inspection of the use of biomarkers as revealed on clinicaltrials.gov shows that amyloid biomarkers are used as entry criterion in 14 phase III disease-modifying agent trials and 17 disease-modifying agent trials in phase II. Twenty-one trials of disease-modifying agents in phase II did not require biomarker confirmation for AD at trial entry. Discussion: The AD drug development pipeline is slightly larger in 2018 than in 2017. Trials increasingly include preclinical and prodromal populations. There is an increase in nonamyloid mechanisms of action for drugs in earlier phases of drug development. Biomarkers are increasingly used in AD drug development but are not used uniformly for AD diagnosis confirmation.},

However, inconsistent or non-existent annotations describing important sample details such as name of tissue or cell line, histopathological type, and subject characteristics like demographics, treatment, and survival are seldom present in data repositories, making it difficult to aggregate data. RESULTS: We created a flexible software tool that allows efficient annotation of samples using a controlled vocabulary, and report on its use for the annotation of over 12,500 samples. CONCLUSION: While the amount of data is very large and seemingly poorly annotated, a lot of information is still within reach. Consistent tool-based re-annotation enables many new possibilities for large scale interpretation and analyses that would otherwise be impossible.},

@article{Enders2017,
abstract = {The last 20 years has seen an uptick in research on missing data problems, and most software applications now implement one or more sophisticated missing data handling routines (e.g., multiple imputation or maximum likelihood estimation). Despite their superior statistical properties (e.g., less stringent assumptions, greater accuracy and power), the adoption of these modern analytic approaches is not uniform in psychology and related disciplines. Thus, the primary goal of this manuscript is to describe and illustrate the application of multiple imputation. Although maximum likelihood estimation is perhaps the easiest method to use in practice, psychological data sets often feature complexities that are currently difficult to handle appropriately in the likelihood framework (e.g., mixtures of categorical and continuous variables), but relatively simple to treat with imputation. The paper describes a number of practical issues that clinical researchers are likely to encounter when applying multiple imputation, including mixtures of categorical and continuous variables, item-level missing data in questionnaires, significance testing, interaction effects, and multilevel missing data. Analysis examples illustrate imputation with software packages that are freely available on the internet.},

It evaluates 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. The severity and frequency of each neuropsychiatric symptom are rated on the basis of scripted questions administered to the patient's caregiver. The NPI also assesses the amount of caregiver distress engendered by each of the neuropsychiatric disorders. A total NPI score and a total caregiver distress score are calculated, in addition to the scores for the individual symptom domains. Content validity, concurrent validity, inter-rater reliability, and test-retest reliability of the NPI are established. Different neurologic disorders have characteristic neuropsychiatric manifestations and distinctive NPI profiles. The NPI is sensitive to treatment effects and has demonstrated the amelioration of behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease by cholinergic agents. The NPI is a useful instrument for characterizing the psychopathology of dementia syndromes, investigating the neurobiology of brain disorders with neuropsychiatric manifestations, distinguishing among different dementia syndromes, and assessing the efficacy of treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of studies relating amyloid pathology with brain volumes have been cross-sectional. Apolipoprotein ɛ4 (APOE ɛ4), a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, is also known to be associated with hippocampal volume loss. No studies have considered the effects of amyloid pathology and APOE ɛ4 together on longitudinal volume loss.

METHODS: We evaluated whether an abnormal level of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid (CSF A$\beta$) and APOE ɛ4 carrier status were independently associated with greater hippocampal volume loss over 1 year. We then assessed whether APOE ɛ4 status and CSF A$\beta$ acted synergistically, testing the significance of an interaction term in the regression analysis. We included 297 participants: 77 cognitively normal, 144 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 76 with Alzheimer's disease.

RESULTS: An abnormal CSF A$\beta$ level was found to be associated with greater hippocampal volume loss over 1 year in each group. APOE ɛ4 was associated with hippocampal volume loss only in the cognitively normal and MCI groups. APOE ɛ4 carriers with abnormal CSF A$\beta$ in the MCI group acted synergistically to produce disproportionately greater volume loss than noncarriers.

CONCLUSION: Baseline CSF A$\beta$ predicts progression of hippocampal volume loss. APOE ɛ4 carrier status amplifies the degree of neurodegeneration in MCI. Understanding the effect of interactions between genetic risk and amyloid pathology will be important in clinical trials and our understanding of the disease process.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in 1974 the use of the term Minimization has been broadened to include other algorithms. All algorithms use patient characteristics to determine the assignment that produces the best overall balance between treatment groups. They differ in whether or not they use all of the data from each previously assigned subject to assign subsequent subjects so the methods are classified as complete or partial minimization. PubMed, Citation Index and Cochrane searches determined the frequency of articles using these types of minimization and a subset was selected for detailed review regarding the adequacy of the usage and reporting of minimization. In the past 10 years usage has increased three fold over the previous decade but is still less than 2{\%} of clinical trials. None of the studies makes maximum use of minimization and they are not following good reporting practices. Concerns about the use of minimization have involved selection bias and statistical analysis. Several modifications to minimization are suggested to reduce the possibility of selection bias so that adding randomization will rarely be required. Separating primary and secondary analyses can avoid the statistical problems that minimization poses. The two types of analyses are distinguished by opposite limiting signs, providing reliable, simplified statistical results. This will improve data utilization and make clinical trials more reproducible. Minimization should be the method of choice in assigning subjects in all clinical trials.},

abstract = {Neurons and glia are generated throughout adulthood from proliferating cells in two regions of the rat brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus. This study shows that exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have differential and site-specific effects on progenitor cells in vivo. Both growth factors expanded the SVZ progenitor population after 2 weeks of intracerebroventricular administration, but only FGF-2 induced an increase in the number of newborn cells, most prominently neurons, in the olfactory bulb, the normal destination for neuronal progenitors migrating from the SVZ. EGF, on the other hand, reduced the total number of newborn neurons reaching the olfactory bulb and substantially enhanced the generation of astrocytes in the olfactory bulb. Moreover, EGF increased the number of newborn cells in the striatum either by migration of SVZ cells or by stimulation of local progenitor cells. No evidence of neuronal differentiation of newborn striatal cells was found by three-dimensional confocal analysis, although many of these newborn cells were associated closely with striatal neurons. The proliferation of hippocampal progenitors was not affected by either growth factor. However, EGF increased the number of newborn glia and reduced the number of newborn neurons, similar to the effects seen in the olfactory bulb. These findings may be useful for elucidating the in vivo role of growth factors in neurogenesis in the adult CNS and may aid development of neuronal replacement strategies after brain damage.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The cause of AD is not known, but genetic evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that pathological aggregation of the $\beta$-amyloid protein (A$\beta$) triggers the disease process. AD has a long preclinical phase, lasting a decade or more. It is during this preclinical phase, before the irreversible neuron loss that characterizes the dementia phase of the disease, that therapies are most likely to be effective. If we are to block AD during the preclinical phase, we must identify the A$\beta$ species that are present before there are overt symptoms and that are associated with downstream markers of pathology. A specific soluble A$\beta$ assembly, the putative dodecamer "A$\beta$*56," is present in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid of cognitively intact individuals and correlates with markers of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury. This assembly also correlates with memory dysfunction in multiple lines of transgenic mice that model the preclinical phase of AD. We suggest that A$\beta$*56 has a critical role during the earliest phase of AD and might serve as a molecular trigger of the disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Item response theory (IRT) promises more sensitive and efficient measurement of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) than traditional approaches; however, the selection and use of PRO measures from IRT-based item banks differ from current methods of using PRO measures.

PURPOSE: To anticipate barriers to the adoption of IRT item banks into clinical trials.

METHODS: We conducted semistructured telephone or in-person interviews with 42 clinical researchers who published results from clinical trials in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the New England Journal of Medicine, or other leading clinical journals from July 2005 through May 2006. Interviews included a brief tutorial on IRT item banks.

RESULTS: After the tutorial, 39 of 42 participants understood the novel products available from an IRT item bank, namely customized short forms and computerized adaptive testing. Most participants (38/42) thought that item banks could be useful in their clinical trials, but they mentioned several potential barriers to adoption, including economic and logistical constraints, concerns about whether item banks are better than current PRO measures, concerns about how to convince study personnel or statisticians to use item banks, concerns about FDA or sponsor acceptance, and the lack of availability of item banks validated in specific disease populations.

LIMITATIONS: Selection bias might have led to more positive responses to the concept of item banks in clinical trials.

CONCLUSIONS: Clinical investigators are open to a new method of PRO measurement offered in IRT item banks, but bank developers must address investigator and stakeholder concerns before widespread adoption can be expected.},

abstract = {Background In a previously reported positive randomized controlled trial of the $\alpha$ 1 -adrenoreceptor ($\alpha$ 1 AR) antagonist prazosin for combat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 67 active duty soldiers, baseline symptoms did not predict therapeutic response. If increased brain $\alpha$ 1 AR activation in PTSD is the target of prazosin treatment action, higher brain $\alpha$ 1 AR activation should predict greater prazosin efficacy. Although brain $\alpha$ 1 AR activation is not measurable, coregulated peripheral $\alpha$ 1 AR activation could provide an estimate of brain $\alpha$ 1 AR activation. Standing blood pressure (BP) is an accessible biological parameter regulated by norepinephrine activation of $\alpha$ 1 ARs on peripheral arterioles. Methods Effects of baseline standing systolic and other BP parameters on PTSD outcome measures from the previously reported randomized controlled trial were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Prazosin participants (n = 32) and placebo participants (n = 35) were analyzed separately. Results In prazosin participants, each 10-mm Hg higher baseline standing systolic BP increment resulted in an additional 14-point reduction (improvement) of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total score at end point (p =.002). All other combinations of baseline BP parameters and PTSD outcome measures were similarly significant or demonstrated trends in the predicted direction. In placebo participants, there was no signal for a baseline BP effect on PTSD outcome measures. Conclusions These findings suggest that higher standing BP is a biomarker that helps identify persons with combat PTSD who are likely to benefit from prazosin. These results also are consistent with $\alpha$ 1 AR activation contributing to PTSD pathophysiology in a subgroup of patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of galantamine in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the ability of galantamine to benefit cognition and global functioning in subjects with MCI, and the ability of galantamine to delay conversion to dementia.

METHODS: In two studies, 2,048 subjects, 990 in Study 1 and 1,058 in Study 2, with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5, CDR memory score {\textgreater} or =0.5, without dementia were randomized to double-blind galantamine (16-24 mg/day) or placebo for 24 months. Primary efficacy endpoint at month 24 was number ({\%}) of subjects who converted from MCI to dementia (CDR {\textgreater} or = 1.0).

RESULTS: There were no differences between galantamine and placebo in 24-month conversion rates (Study 1: 22.9{\%} [galantamine] vs 22.6{\%} [placebo], p = 0.146; Study 2: 25.4{\%} [galantamine] vs 31.2{\%} [placebo], p = 0.619). Mean CDR-sum of boxes declined less with galantamine than placebo at 12 and 24 months in Study 1 (p = 0.024 [12 months] and p = 0.028 [24 months]), but not in Study 2 (p = 0.662 [12 months] and p = 0.056 [24 months]). Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores improved with galantamine in Study 1 at 12 months and in Study 2 at 24 months (Study 1: p = 0.009 [month 12] and p = 0.079 [Month 24]; Study 2: p = 0.154 [month 12] and p = 0.020 [month 24]). The most frequently reported adverse event was nausea (galantamine, 29{\%}; placebo, 10{\%}). Serious AEs occurred in 19{\%} of each group. Mortality of the cohort after retrospectively determining the status of subjects (98.3{\%}) at 24 months was 1.4{\%} (galantamine) and 0.3{\%} (placebo); RR (95{\%} CI), 1.70 (1.00, 2.90).

CONCLUSIONS: Galantamine failed to significantly influence conversion to dementia. Galantamine was generally well tolerated. Whereas recorded mortality was greater in the galantamine group than in the placebo group in the original per-protocol assessment, a post hoc analysis of the cohort was consistent with no increased risk.},

abstract = {The demand for unequal allocation in clinical trials is growing. Most commonly, the unequal allocation is achieved through permuted block randomization. However, other allocation procedures might be required to better approximate the allocation ratio in small samples, reduce the selection bias in open-label studies, or balance on baseline covariates. When these allocation procedures are generalized to unequal allocation, special care is to be taken to preserve the allocation ratio at every allocation step. This paper offers a way to expand the biased coin randomization to unequal allocation that preserves the allocation ratio at every allocation. The suggested expansion works with biased coin randomization that balances only on treatment group totals and with covariate-adaptive procedures that use a random biased coin element at every allocation. Balancing properties of the allocation ratio preserving biased coin randomization and minimization are described through simulations. It is demonstrated that these procedures are asymptotically protected against the shift in the rerandomization distribution identified for some examples of minimization with 1:2 allocation. The asymptotic shift in the rerandomization distribution of the difference in treatment means for an arbitrary unequal allocation procedure is explicitly derived in the paper.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Adaptive designs can make clinical trials more flexible by utilising results accumulating in the trial to modify the trial's course in accordance with pre-specified rules. Trials with an adaptive design are often more efficient, informative and ethical than trials with a traditional fixed design since they often make better use of resources such as time and money, and might require fewer participants. Adaptive designs can be applied across all phases of clinical research, from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory trials. The pace of the uptake of adaptive designs in clinical research, however, has remained well behind that of the statistical literature introducing new methods and highlighting their potential advantages. We speculate that one factor contributing to this is that the full range of adaptations available to trial designs, as well as their goals, advantages and limitations, remains unfamiliar to many parts of the clinical community. Additionally, the term adaptive design has been misleadingly used as an all-encompassing label to refer to certain methods that could be deemed controversial or that have been inadequately implemented. We believe that even if the planning and analysis of a trial is undertaken by an expert statistician, it is essential that the investigators understand the implications of using an adaptive design, for example, what the practical challenges are, what can (and cannot) be inferred from the results of such a trial, and how to report and communicate the results. This tutorial paper provides guidance on key aspects of adaptive designs that are relevant to clinical triallists. We explain the basic rationale behind adaptive designs, clarify ambiguous terminology and summarise the utility and pitfalls of adaptive designs. We discuss practical aspects around funding, ethical approval, treatment supply and communication with stakeholders and trial participants. Our focus, however, is on the interpretation and reporting of results from adaptive design trials, which we consider vital for anyone involved in medical research. We emphasise the general principles of transparency and reproducibility and suggest how best to put them into practice.},

More recently there has been interest in adjusting sample sizes based on event rates, easy if the treatment group rates remain blinded but possible even with unblinded analysis. In large trials, group sequential analytic approaches are routine. Early stopping however, can reduce available data and in cardiac trials we have generally urged use of only survival as the basis for stopping, even if the primary endpoint is a composite (death, new AMI, etc). Other possibilities include adaptive randomization and starting additional dose groups. Enrichment designs focus on populations with a higher event rate or on populations more likely to respond. They can reduce sample sizes and target therapy toward people most likely to benefit.},

The factors causing these errors were mistakes in interpretation, documentation, and coding. The level of experience of the data managers proved to be an important factor.

As currently con-ceptualized, a primary pre-vention trial recruits asymp-tomatic individuals from the general population, whereas an SPT recruits only asymptomatic (or preclinical) individu-als who are biomarker-positive for AD. 1 Recent examples of the latter include the AD kindred trial in Antioquia, Colombia, which recruits only participants who are PS1 E280A mutation carriers with a familial history of early-onset disease, and the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study (hereafter referred to as the A4 study), which targets adults 70 years of age or older with high amyloid levels in the brain as determined by a positron emission tomographic scan. The lat-ter study is the subject of the article by Donohue et al, 2 who seek to identify a primary end point for that SPT. The widely accepted gold standard end point of any pre-vention trial is AD incidence. It takes many years and a large number of participants to demonstrate that an effective treat-ment delays or decreases incidence. 3 Primary prevention trials},

METHODS: Baseline and 12-month follow-up neuropsychological and morphometric measures were examined for healthy control subjects and patients with AD. The two AD groups were divided further into subgroups on the basis of the presence of at least one APOE $\epsilon$4 allele.

RESULTS: The YOAD group showed more severe deficits and steeper declines in cognition than the VOAD group. Moreover, the presence of an APOE $\epsilon$4 allele had a more deleterious effect on the YOAD group than the VOAD group on cognition and brain structure both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

CONCLUSIONS: Results underscore the importance of integrating an individual's age and genetic susceptibility-and their interaction-when examining neuropsychological and neuroimaging changes in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for therapies that slow or reverse the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Neurotrophic factors can improve the function of degenerating neurons and protect against further neurodegeneration, and gene transfer might be a means to deliver effectively these factors to the brain. The aim of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of gene delivery of the neurotrophic factor neurturin.

METHODS: In this phase I, open-label clinical trial, 12 patients aged 35-75 years with a diagnosis of PD for at least 5 years in accordance with the UK Brain Bank Criteria received bilateral, stereotactic, intraputaminal injections of adeno-associated virus serotype 2-neurturin (CERE-120). The first six patients received doses of 1.3x10(11) vector genomes (vg)/patient, and the next six patients received 5.4x10(11) vg/patient. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00252850.

FINDINGS: The procedure was well tolerated. Extensive safety monitoring in all patients revealed no clinically significant adverse events at 1 year. Several secondary measures of motor function showed improvement at 1 year; for example, a mean improvement in the off-medication motor subscore of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) of 14 points (SD 8; p=0.000121 [36{\%} mean increase; p=0.000123]) and a mean increase of 2.3 h (2; 25{\%} group mean increase; p=0.0250) in on time without troublesome dyskinesia were seen. Improvements in several secondary measures were not significant, including the timed walking test in the off condition (p=0.053), the Purdue pegboard test of hand dexterity (p=0.318), the reduction in off time (p=0.105), and the activities of daily living subscore (part II) of the UPDRS (p=0.080). (18)F-levodopa-uptake PET did not change after treatment with either dose of CERE-120.

INTERPRETATION: The initial data support the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of CERE-120 as a possible treatment for PD; however, these results must be viewed as preliminary until data from blinded, controlled clinical trials are available.

abstract = {Background Development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly focused on more mildly affected populations, and requires new assessment and outcome strategies. Patients in early stages of AD have mild cognitive decline and no, or limited, functional impairment. To respond to these assessment challenges, we developed a measurement approach based on established scale items that exhibited change in previous amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) trials. Methods Partial least squares regression with a longitudinal clinical decline model identified items from commonly used clinical scales with the highest combined sensitivity to change over time in aMCI and weighted these items according to their relative contribution to detecting clinical progression in patients' early stages of AD. The resultant AD Composite Score (ADCOMS) was assessed for its ability to detect treatment effect in aMCI/prodromal AD (pAD) clinical trial populations. Results ADCOMS consists of 4 Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale items, 2 Mini-Mental State Examination items, and all 6 Clinical Dementia Rating—Sum of Boxes items. ADCOMS demonstrated improved sensitivity to clinical decline over individual scales in pAD, aMCI and in mild AD dementia. ADCOMS also detected treatment effects associated with the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in these populations. Improved sensitivity predicts smaller sample size requirements when ADCOMS is used in early AD trials. Conclusions ADCOMS is proposed as new standard outcome for pAD and mild AD dementia trials, and is progressing in a CAMD-sponsored qualification process for use in registration trials of pAD.},

abstract = {Missing data, and the bias they can cause, are an almost ever-present concern in clinical trials. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach has been frequently utilized to handle missing data in clinical trials, and is often specified in conjunction with analysis of variance (LOCF ANOVA) for the primary analysis. Considerable advances in statistical methodology, and in our ability to implement these methods, have been made in recent years. Likelihood-based, mixed-effects model approaches implemented under the missing at random (MAR) framework are now easy to implement, and are commonly used to analyse clinical trial data. Furthermore, such approaches are more robust to the biases from missing data, and provide better control of Type I and Type II errors than LOCF ANOVA. Empirical research and analytic proof have demonstrated that the behaviour of LOCF is uncertain, and in many situations it has not been conservative. Using LOCF as a composite measure of safety, tolerability and efficacy can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the effectiveness of a drug. This approach also violates the fundamental basis of statistics as it involves testing an outcome that is not a physical parameter of the population, but rather a quantity that can be influenced by investigator behaviour, trial design, etc. Practice should shift away from using LOCF ANOVA as the primary analysis and focus on likelihood-based, mixed-effects model approaches developed under the MAR framework, with missing not at random methods used to assess robustness of the primary analysis.

abstract = {In clinical trials it is often desirable to test for non-inferiority and for superiority simultaneously. For such a situation a two-stage adaptive procedure may be advantageous to a conventional single-stage procedure because a two-stage adaptive procedure allows the design of stage II, including the main study objective and sample size, to depend on the outcome of stage I. We propose a framework for designing two-stage adaptive procedures with a possible switch of the primary study objectives at the end of stage I between non-inferiority and superiority. The framework permits control of the type I error rate and specification of the unconditional powers and maximum sample size for each of non-inferiority and superiority objectives. The actions at the end of stage I are predetermined as functions of the stage I observations, thus making specification of the unconditional powers possible. Based on the results at the end of stage I, the primary objective for stage II is chosen, and sample sizes and critical values for stage II are determined.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Phase II/III trials, administration of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6/11/16/18) L1 virus-like-particle vaccine was highly effective in preventing HPV6/11/16/18-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and non-invasive cervical cancer in women aged 16-26 years who were na{\"{i}}ve to these HPV types at enrollment. However, the makeup and extent of catch-up vaccination programs among young women is unclear, because a proportion of this population will likely already have been exposed to one or more vaccine-HPV-types. OBJECTIVE: Herein we analyze baseline data from the quadrivalent HPV vaccine clinical trial program to investigate variables which may help shape catch-up vaccine implementation policies. METHODS: Female adolescents and young adults aged 16-26 years were randomized into five clinical trials. Baseline data regarding demographics, sexual history, pregnancy history, and other characteristics were collected at enrollment. At the baseline gynecological examination during enrollment, specimens were obtained for Pap testing. Swabs of external genital, lateral vaginal, and cervical sites for HPV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing were taken, and serum samples were obtained for HPV serology testing. Regional analyses of data were conducted. RESULTS: Overall, 72{\%} of subjects enrolled worldwide were na{\"{i}}ve by both serology and PCR to all four vaccine HPV types. Few subjects were seropositive and/or PCR positive for more than two vaccine-related HPV types. Of all subjects with HSIL at enrollment, 78{\%} were positive to at least one vaccine-related HPV type at enrollment. Regional differences in HPV and STD prevalence were evident. Study limitations included under-representation of women with {\textgreater}/=4 sexual partners and possible underestimation of prior HPV exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that sexually active 16-26 year-old women with {\textless}/=4 life time sex partners (LSP) in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific are generally na{\"{i}}ve to most or all types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine and that they are at subsequent risk for infection and disease caused by these types.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Memantine is a low- to moderate-affinity, uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. Controlled trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of memantine monotherapy for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease (AD) but no controlled trials of memantine in patients receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor have been performed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of memantine vs placebo in patients with moderate to severe AD already receiving stable treatment with donepezil. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 404 patients with moderate to severe AD and Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 5 to 14, who received stable doses of donepezil, conducted at 37 US sites between June 11, 2001, and June 3, 2002. A total of 322 patients (80{\%}) completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive memantine (starting dose 5 mg/d, increased to 20 mg/d, n = 203) or placebo (n = 201) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change from baseline on the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), a measure of cognition, and on a modified 19-item AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL19). Secondary outcomes included a Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the Behavioral Rating Scale for Geriatric Patients (BGP Care Dependency Subscale). RESULTS: The change in total mean (SE) scores favored memantine vs placebo treatment for SIB (possible score range, 0-100), 0.9 (0.67) vs -2.5 (0.69), respectively (P{\textless}.001); ADCS-ADL19 (possible score range, 0-54), -2.0 (0.50) vs -3.4 (0.51), respectively (P =.03); and the CIBIC-Plus (possible score range, 1-7), 4.41 (0.074) vs 4.66 (0.075), respectively (P =.03). All other secondary measures showed significant benefits of memantine treatment. Treatment discontinuations because of adverse events for memantine vs placebo were 15 (7.4{\%}) vs 25 (12.4{\%}), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate to severe AD receiving stable doses of donepezil, memantine resulted in significantly better outcomes than placebo on measures of cognition, activities of daily living, global outcome, and behavior and was well tolerated. These results, together with previous studies, suggest that memantine represents a new approach for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To empirically assess the concept that Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers significantly depart from normality in a temporally ordered manner.

DESIGN: Validation sample.

SETTING: Multisite, referral centers.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 401 elderly participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who were cognitively normal, who had mild cognitive impairment, or who had AD dementia. We compared the proportions of 3 AD biomarker values (the A$\beta$42 level in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], the total tau level in CSF, and the hippocampal volume adjusted for intracranial volume [hereafter referred to as the adjusted hippocampal volume]) that were abnormal as cognitive impairment worsened. Cut points demarcating normal vs abnormal for each biomarker were established by maximizing diagnostic accuracy in independent autopsy samples.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three AD biomarkers (ie, the CSF A$\beta$42 level, the CSF total tau level, and the adjusted hippocampal volume).

RESULTS: Within each clinical group of the entire sample (n = 401), the CSF A$\beta$42 level was abnormal more often than was the CSF total tau level or the adjusted hippocampal volume. Among the 298 participants with both baseline and 12-month data, the proportion of participants with an abnormal A$\beta$42 level did not change from baseline to 12 months in any group. The proportion of participants with an abnormal total tau level increased from baseline to 12 months in cognitively normal participants (P = .05) but not in participants with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia. For 209 participants with an abnormal CSF A$\beta$42 level at baseline, the percentage with an abnormal adjusted hippocampal volume but normal CSF total tau level increased from baseline to 12 months in participants with mild cognitive impairment. No change in the percentage of MCI participants with an abnormal total tau level was seen between baseline and 12 months.

CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the CSF A$\beta$42 level denotes a pathophysiological process that significantly departs from normality (ie, becomes dynamic) early, whereas the CSF total tau level and the adjusted hippocampal volume are biomarkers of downstream pathophysiological processes. The CSF total tau level becomes dynamic before the adjusted hippocampal volume, but the hippocampal volume is more dynamic in the clinically symptomatic mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia phases of the disease than is the CSF total tau level.},

abstract = {Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal $\beta$-amyloid deposition (A$\beta$+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A$\beta$ deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A$\beta$ to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A$\beta$ pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A$\beta$ deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by “classic” AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Many observational studies have shown that physical activity reduces the risk of cognitive decline; however, evidence from randomized trials is lacking.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physical activity reduces the rate of cognitive decline among older adults at risk.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized controlled trial of a 24-week physical activity intervention conducted between 2004 and 2007 in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. Assessors of cognitive function were blinded to group membership.

PARTICIPANTS: We recruited volunteers who reported memory problems but did not meet criteria for dementia. Three hundred eleven individuals aged 50 years or older were screened for eligibility, 89 were not eligible, and 52 refused to participate. A total of 170 participants were randomized and 138 participants completed the 18-month assessment.

INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly allocated to an education and usual care group or to a 24-week home-based program of physical activity.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Change in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores (possible range, 0-70) over 18 months.

RESULTS: In an intent-to-treat analysis, participants in the intervention group improved 0.26 points (95{\%} confidence interval, -0.89 to 0.54) and those in the usual care group deteriorated 1.04 points (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.32 to 1.82) on the ADAS-Cog at the end of the intervention. The absolute difference of the outcome measure between the intervention and control groups was -1.3 points (95{\%} confidence interval,-2.38 to -0.22) at the end of the intervention. At 18 months, participants in the intervention group improved 0.73 points (95{\%} confidence interval, -1.27 to 0.03) on the ADAS-Cog, and those in the usual care group improved 0.04 points (95{\%} confidence interval, -0.46 to 0.88). Word list delayed recall and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes improved modestly as well, whereas word list total immediate recall, digit symbol coding, verbal fluency, Beck depression score, and Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short-Form physical and mental component summaries did not change significantly.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study of adults with subjective memory impairment, a 6-month program of physical activity provided a modest improvement in cognition over an 18-month follow-up period.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Identifying predictors of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critically important for AD prevention and targeted treatment. OBJECTIVE To compare various clinical and biomarker trajectories for tracking progression and predicting conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to probable AD. METHODS Participants were from the ADNI-1 study. We assessed the ability of 33 longitudinal biomarkers to predict time to AD conversion, accounting for demographic and genetic factors. We used joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data to examine the association between changes of measures and disease progression. We also employed time-dependent receiver operating characteristic method to assess the discriminating capability of the measures. RESULTS 23 of 33 longitudinal clinical and imaging measures are significant predictors of AD conversion beyond demographic and genetic factors. The strong phenotypic and biological predictors are in the cognitive domain (ADAS-Cog; RAVLT), functional domain (FAQ), and neuroimaging domain (middle temporal gyrus and hippocampal volume). The strongest predictor is ADAS-Cog 13 with an increase of one SD in ADAS-Cog 13 increased the risk of AD conversion by 2.92 times. CONCLUSION Prediction of AD conversion can be improved by incorporating longitudinal change information, in addition to baseline characteristics. Cognitive measures are consistently significant and generally stronger predictors than imaging measures.},

abstract = {The levels of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), as measured in cerebrospinal fluid, have been associated with the risk of progressing from normal cognition to onset of clinical symptoms during preclinical Alzheimer's disease. We examined whether cognitive reserve (CR) modifies this association. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained at baseline from 239 participants (mean age, 57.2 years) who had been followed for up to 17 years with clinical and cognitive assessments (mean follow-up, 8 years). A composite score based on the National Adult Reading Test, vocabulary, and years of education at baseline was used as an index of CR. Cox regression models showed that the increased risk of progressing from normal cognition to symptom onset was associated with lower CR, lower baseline A$\beta$, and higher baseline p-tau. There was no interaction between CR and A$\beta$, suggesting that the protective effects of higher CR are equivalent across the observed range of amyloid levels. In contrast, both tau and p-tau interacted with CR, indicating that CR was more protective at lower levels of tau and p-tau.},

abstract = {AIMS: To estimate agreement among scores on three common assessments of cognitive function.

METHOD: Baseline responses on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive, Clinical Dementia Rating, and the Mini-Mental State Examination were obtained from two clinical trials (n = 138 and n = 351). A graphical method of examining agreement, the means-difference or Bland-Altman plot, was followed by Levene's test of the equality of variance corrected for multiple comparison within each sample.

RESULTS: 70-78{\%} of variability was shared by one factor, suggesting that all three instruments reflect cognitive impairment. However, agreement among tests was significantly worse for individuals with greater-than-average, relative to individuals with less-than-average, cognitive impairment.

CONCLUSIONS: Worse agreement between tests, as a function of increasing cognitive impairment, implies that interpretation of these tests and selection of coprimary cognitive impairment outcomes may depend on impairment level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A mixed-effects model repeated measures approach (MMRM) was specified as the primary analysis in the Phase III clinical trials of duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Analysis of covariance using the last observation carried forward approach to impute missing values (LOCF{\_}ANCOVA) was specified as a secondary analysis. Previous research has shown that MMRM and LOCF{\_}ANCOVA yield identical endpoint results when no data are missing, while MMRM is more robust to biases from missing data and thereby provides superior control of Type I and Type II error compared with LOCF{\_}ANCOVA. We compared results from MMRM and LOCF{\_}ANCOVA analyses across eight clinical trials of duloxetine in order to investigate how the choice of primary analysis may influence interpretations of efficacy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Results were obtained from the eight acute-phase clinical trials that formed the basis of duloxetine's New Drug Application for the treatment of MDD. All 202 mean change analyses from the 20 rating scale total scores and subscales specified a priori in the various protocols were included in the comparisons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 166/202 comparisons (82.2{\%}), MMRM and LOCF{\_}ANCOVA agreed with regard to the statistical significance of the differences between duloxetine and placebo. In 25/202 cases (12.4{\%}), MMRM yielded a significant difference when LOCF{\_}ANCOVA did not, while in 11/202 cases (5.4{\%}), LOCF{\_}ANCOVA produced a significant difference when MMRM did not. In 110/202 comparisons (54.4{\%}) the p-value from MMRM was lower than that from LOCF{\_}ANCOVA, while in 69/202 comparisons (34.2{\%}), the p-value from LOCF{\_}ANCOVA was lower than that from MMRM. In the remaining 23 comparisons (11.4{\%}), the p-values from LOCF{\_}ANCOVA and MMRM were equal when rounded to the 3rd decimal place (usually as a result of both p-values being {\textless}.001). For the HAMD17 total score, the primary outcome in all studies, MMRM yielded 9/12 (75{\%}) significant contrasts, compared with 6/12 (50{\%}) for LOCF{\_}ANCOVA. The expected success rate was 80{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Important differences exist between MMRM and LOCF{\_}ANCOVA. Empirical research has clearly demonstrated the theoretical advantages of MMRM over LOCF{\_}ANCOVA. However, interpretations regarding the efficacy of duloxetine in MDD were unaffected by the choice of analytical technique.},

abstract = {A recently identified variant within the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is carried by 46{\%} of Western Europeans and is associated with an approximately 1.2 kg higher weight, on average, in adults and an approximately 1 cm greater waist circumference. With {\textgreater}1 billion overweight and 300 million obese persons worldwide, it is crucial to understand the implications of carrying this very common allele for the health of our aging population. FTO is highly expressed in the brain and elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with brain atrophy, but it is unknown how the obesity-associated risk allele affects human brain structure. We therefore generated 3D maps of regional brain volume differences in 206 healthy elderly subjects scanned with MRI and genotyped as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found a pattern of systematic brain volume deficits in carriers of the obesity-associated risk allele versus noncarriers. Relative to structure volumes in the mean template, FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers had an average brain volume difference of approximately 8{\%} in the frontal lobes and 12{\%} in the occipital lobes-these regions also showed significant volume deficits in subjects with higher BMI. These brain differences were not attributable to differences in cholesterol levels, hypertension, or the volume of white matter hyperintensities; which were not detectably higher in FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers. These brain maps reveal that a commonly carried susceptibility allele for obesity is associated with structural brain atrophy, with implications for the health of the elderly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The most appropriate targets for systolic blood pressure to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among persons without diabetes remain uncertain. METHODS We randomly assigned 9361 persons with a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes, to a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS At 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group. The intervention was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years owing to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.65{\%} per year vs. 2.19{\%} per year; hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P{\textless}0.001). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95{\%} CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P=0.003). Rates of serious adverse events of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure, but not of injurious falls, were higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, although significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) represent neurodegenerative tauopathies with predominantly cortical versus subcortical disease burden. In Alzheimer's disease, neuropathology and atrophy preferentially affect 'hub' brain regions that are densely connected. It was unclear whether hubs are differentially affected by neurodegeneration because they are more likely to receive pathological proteins that propagate trans-neuronally, in a prion-like manner, or whether they are selectively vulnerable due to a lack of local trophic factors, higher metabolic demands, or differential gene expression. We assessed the relationship between tau burden and brain functional connectivity, by combining in vivo PET imaging using the ligand AV-1451, and graph theoretic measures of resting state functional MRI in 17 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 17 patients with PSP, and 12 controls. Strongly connected nodes displayed more tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease, independently of intrinsic connectivity network, validating the predictions of theories of trans-neuronal spread but not supporting a role for metabolic demands or deficient trophic support in tau accumulation. This was not a compensatory phenomenon, as the functional consequence of increasing tau burden in Alzheimer's disease was a progressive weakening of the connectivity of these same nodes, reducing weighted degree and local efficiency and resulting in weaker 'small-world' properties. Conversely, in PSP, unlike in Alzheimer's disease, those nodes that accrued pathological tau were those that displayed graph metric properties associated with increased metabolic demand and a lack of trophic support rather than strong functional connectivity. Together, these findings go some way towards explaining why Alzheimer's disease affects large scale connectivity networks throughout cortex while neuropathology in PSP is concentrated in a small number of subcortical structures. Further, we demonstrate that in PSP increasing tau burden in midbrain and deep nuclei was associated with strengthened cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Disrupted cortico-subcortical and cortico-brainstem inter-actions meant that information transfer took less direct paths, passing through a larger number of cortical nodes, reducing closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality in PSP, while increasing weighted degree, clustering, betweenness centrality and local efficiency. Our results have wide-ranging implications, from the validation of models of tau trafficking in humans to under-standing the relationship between regional tau burden and brain functional reorganization.},

abstract = {Rats received bilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis by infusion of ibotenic acid. Fourteen days later, osmotic minipumps releasing human recombinant nerve growth factor (0.3 micrograms/day) were implanted subcutaneously. Starting one month after the lesion, spatial learning of the animals was tested using the Morris water maze. Acquisition of the task was impaired by the lesion, but treatment with nerve growth factor reduced the average latency to find the platform by approximately 9 s, which represents 28{\%} of the lesion-induced behavioral deficit. Retention of this task and spatial acuity, tested in a trial in which the platform was not present, did not show a statistically significant improvement. Lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis reduced the choline acetyltransferase activity in the neocortex, but not in the hippocampus. Treatment with nerve growth factor increased the choline acetyltransferase activity in the neocortex but not in the hippocampus. There was no significant difference in the levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin or their metabolites in the cortex or hippocampus between nerve growth factor-treated animals and lesioned control animals. There was no significant correlation between any of these neurochemical changes and behavioral performance (acquisition and spatial acuity). Treatment with nerve growth factor did not increase the number or the size of nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive neurons in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. These data suggest that delayed treatment with nerve growth factor results in an improvement of spatial learning in rats with lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. A possible role for cholinergic mechanisms in this effect is discussed.},

abstract = {Much progress has been made over the past decade with the development of novel methods for addressing increasingly more complex multiplicity problems arising in confirmatory Phase III clinical trials. This includes traditional problems with a single source of multiplicity, for example, analysis of multiple endpoints or dose-placebo contrasts. In addition, more advanced problems with several sources of multiplicity have attracted attention in clinical drug development. These problems include two or more families of objectives such as multiple endpoints evaluated at multiple dose levels or in multiple patient populations. This paper provides a review of concepts that play a central role in defining and solving multiplicity problems (error rate definitions) and introduces main classes of multiple testing procedures widely used in clinical trials (nonparametric, semiparametric, and parametric procedures). The paper also presents recent advances in multiplicity research, including gatekeeping procedures for clinical trials with multiple sets of objectives. The concepts and methods introduced in the paper are illustrated using several case studies on the basis of real clinical trials. Software implementation of commonly used multiple testing and gatekeeping procedures is discussed.},

abstract = {Rats received bilateral quisqualic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. Three weeks after lesioning, osmotic minipumps were implanted that released recombinant human nerve growth factor or cytochrome c at a dosage of 5.0 microg rat-1 day-1 through intracerebroventricular cannulas for 7 weeks. One quarter of the rats were sacrificed at the end of the treatment, while the rest of the animals were sacrificed 2, 8, and 12 weeks after termination of NGF/cc treatment. ICV administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) transiently reduced weight gain. NGF maximally increased choline acetyltransferase activity in all cortical regions, the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus between 20{\%} and 56{\%} at the end of the treatment. This increase linearly declined and completely regressed during the 12-week withdrawal period both in regions affected and unaffected by the lesion. Administration of NGF induced a short-lasting hypertrophy of low affinity NGF receptor immunoreactive neurons within the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM), the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, and the medial septum. In contrast, QUIS-induced NBM lesions permanently reduced ChAT activity most pronounced in the frontal and parietal cortex up to 45{\%}. Furthermore, QUIS induced a permanent loss of p75NGFr-immunoreactive neurons within the NBM and the DB without affecting the MS. These findings suggest that degenerating cholinergic neurons of the NBM and HDB do not spontaneously recover after lesioning and may require continuous neurotrophic support by NGF to ameliorate cholinergic hypofunctioning.},

abstract = {Dynamic allocation of participants to treatments in a clinical trial has been an alternative to randomization for nearly 35 years. Design-adaptive allocation is a particularly flexible kind of dynamic allocation. Every investigation of dynamic allocation methods has shown that they improve balance of prognostic factors across treatment groups, but there have been lingering doubts about their influence on the validity of statistical inferences. Here we report the results of a simulation study focused on this and similar issues. Overall, it is found that there are no statistical reasons, in the situations studied, to prefer randomization to design-adaptive allocation. Specifically, there is no evidence of bias, the number of participants wasted by randomization in small studies is not trivial, and when the aim is to place bounds on the prediction of population benefits, randomization is quite substantially less efficient than design-adaptive allocation. A new, adjusted permutation estimate of the standard deviation of the regression estimator under design-adaptive allocation is shown to be an unbiased estimate of the true sampling standard deviation, resolving a long-standing problem with dynamic allocations. These results are shown in situations with varying numbers of balancing factors, different treatment and covariate effects, different covariate distributions, and in the presence of a small number of outliers.},

abstract = {Multifactorial mechanisms underlying late-onset Alzheimer/'s disease (LOAD) are poorly characterized from an integrative perspective. Here spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-[beta] deposition, metabolism, vascular, functional activity at rest, structural properties, cognitive integrity and peripheral proteins levels are characterized in relation to LOAD progression. We analyse over 7,700 brain images and tens of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers from the Alzheimer/'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Through a multifactorial data-driven analysis, we obtain dynamic LOAD-abnormality indices for all biomarkers, and a tentative temporal ordering of disease progression. Imaging results suggest that intra-brain vascular dysregulation is an early pathological event during disease development. Cognitive decline is noticeable from initial LOAD stages, suggesting early memory deficit associated with the primary disease factors. High abnormality levels are also observed for specific proteins associated with the vascular system/'s integrity. Although still subjected to the sensitivity of the algorithms and biomarkers employed, our results might contribute to the development of preventive therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System (LORIS) is a modular and extensible web-based data management system that integrates all aspects of a multi-center study: from heterogeneous data acquisition (imaging, clinical, behavior, and genetics) to storage, processing, and ultimately dissemination. It provides a secure, user-friendly, and streamlined platform to automate the flow of clinical trials and complex multi-center studies. A subject-centric internal organization allows researchers to capture and subsequently extract all information, longitudinal or cross-sectional, from any subset of the study cohort. Extensive error-checking and quality control procedures, security, data management, data querying, and administrative functions provide LORIS with a triple capability (1) continuous project coordination and monitoring of data acquisition (2) data storage/cleaning/querying, (3) interface with arbitrary external data processing "pipelines." LORIS is a complete solution that has been thoroughly tested through a full 10 year life cycle of a multi-center longitudinal project and is now supporting numerous international neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration research projects.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is among the first structures affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hippocampal magnetic resonance imaging volumetry is a potential biomarker for AD but is hindered by the limitations of manual segmentation. We proposed a fully automatic method using probabilistic and anatomical priors for hippocampus segmentation. Probabilistic information is derived from 16 young controls and anatomical knowledge is modeled with automatically detected landmarks. The results were previously evaluated by comparison with manual segmentation on data from the 16 young healthy controls, with a leave-one-out strategy, and eight patients with AD. High accuracy was found for both groups (volume error 6 and 7{\%}, overlap 87 and 86{\%}, respectively). In this article, the method was used to segment 145 patients with AD, 294 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 166 elderly normal subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. On the basis of a qualitative rating protocol, the segmentation proved acceptable in 94{\%} of the cases. We used the obtained hippocampal volumes to automatically discriminate between AD patients, MCI patients, and elderly controls. The classification proved accurate: 76{\%} of the patients with AD and 71{\%} of the MCI converting to AD before 18 months were correctly classified with respect to the elderly controls, using only hippocampal volume.},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

abstract = {Cornerstone for an efficient cardiac gene therapy is the need for a vector system, which enables selective and long-term expression of the gene of interest. In rodent animal models adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors like AAV-6 have been shown to efficiently transduce cardiomyocytes. However, since significant species-dependent differences in transduction characteristics exist, large animal models are of imminent need for preclinical evaluations. We compared gene transfer efficiencies of AAV-6 and heparin binding site-deleted AAV-2 vectors in a porcine model. Application of the AAVs was performed by pressure-regulated retroinfusion of the anterior interventricular cardiac vein, which has been previously shown to efficiently deliver genes to the myocardium (3.5 x 10(10) viral genomes per animal; n=5 animals per group). All vectors harbored a luciferase reporter gene under control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-enhanced 1.5 kb rat myosin light chain promoter (CMV-MLC2v). Expression levels were evaluated 4 weeks after gene transfer by determining luciferase activities. To rule out a systemic spillover peripheral tissue was analyzed by PCR for the presence of vector genomes. Selective retroinfusion of AAV serotype 6 vectors into the anterior cardiac vein substantially increased reporter gene expression in the targeted distal left anterior descending (LAD) territory (65 943+/-31 122 vs control territory 294+/-69, P{\textless}0.05). Retroinfusion of AAV-2 vectors showed lower transgene expression, which could be increased with coadministration of recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (1365+/-707 no vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) vs 38 760+/-2448 with VEGF, P{\textless}0.05). Significant transgene expression was not detected in other organs than the heart, although vector genomes were detected also in the lung and liver. Thus, selective retroinfusion of AAV-6 into the coronary vein led to efficient long-term myocardial reporter gene expression in the targeted LAD area of the porcine heart. Coapplication of VEGF significantly increased transduction efficiency of AAV-2.},

abstract = {For a variety of reasons including poorly designed case report forms (CRFs), incomplete or invalid CRF data entries, and premature treatment or study discontinuations, missing data is a common phenomenon in controlled clinical trials. With the widely accepted use of the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis dataset as the primary analysis dataset for the analysis of controlled clinical trial data, the presence of missing data could lead to complicated data analysis strategies and subsequently to controversy in the interpretation of trial results. In this article, we review the mechanisms of missing data and some common approaches to analyzing missing data with an emphasis on study dropouts. We discuss the importance of understanding the reasons for study dropouts with ways to assess the mechanisms of missingness. Finally, we discuss the results of a comparative Monte Carlo investigation of the performance characteristics of commonly utilized statistical methods for the analysis of clinical trial data with dropouts. The methods investigated include the mixed effects model for repeated measurements (MMRM), weighted and unweighted generalized estimating equations (GEE) method for the available case data, multiple-imputation-based GEE (MI-GEE), complete case (CC) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and last observation carried forward (LOCF) ANCOVA. Simulation experiments for the repeated measures model with missing at random (MAR) dropout, under varying dropout rates and intrasubject correlation, show that the LOCF, ANCOVA, and weighted GEE methods perform poorly in terms of percent relative bias for estimating a difference in means effect, while the MI-GEE and weighted GEE methods both have less power for rejecting a zero difference in means hypothesis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A variety of measurements have been individually linked to decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but the identification of optimal markers for predicting disease progression remains unresolved. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic ability of genetic, CSF, neuroimaging, and cognitive measurements obtained in the same participants.

METHODS: APOE epsilon4 allele frequency, CSF proteins (Abeta(1-42), total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau [p-tau(181p)]), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), hippocampal volume, and episodic memory performance were evaluated at baseline in patients with amnestic MCI (n = 85), using data from a large multisite study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). Patients were classified as normal or abnormal on each predictor variable based on externally derived cutoffs, and then variables were evaluated as predictors of subsequent conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) during a variable follow-up period (1.9 +/- 0.4 years).

RESULTS: Patients with MCI converted to AD at an annual rate of 17.2{\%}. Subjects with MCI who had abnormal results on both FDG-PET and episodic memory were 11.7 times more likely to convert to AD than subjects who had normal results on both measures (p {\textless}or= 0.02). In addition, the CSF ratio p-tau(181p)/Abeta(1-42) (beta = 1.10 +/- 0.53; p = 0.04) and, marginally, FDG-PET predicted cognitive decline.

CONCLUSIONS: Baseline FDG-PET and episodic memory predict conversion to AD, whereas p-tau(181p)/Abeta(1-42) and, marginally, FDG-PET predict longitudinal cognitive decline. Complementary information provided by these biomarkers may aid in future selection of patients for clinical trials or identification of patients likely to benefit from a therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Factors that affect the rate of progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) need to be considered in the clinical trial designs of potential disease-modifying therapies.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of age on AD course in a clinical trial setting.

DESIGN: Pooled cohort study from 3 AD clinical trials of 18-month duration conducted by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study group.

SETTING: Alzheimer disease research centers from across the United States.

PATIENTS: Four hundred seventy-one subjects with mild to moderate AD assigned to the placebo arm of 3 clinical trials.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationships between baseline age and rate of change in the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) 11, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes score, Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study–activities of daily living scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory were analyzed using a mixed-effect regression model. Sample size calculation for possible future AD clinical trials lasting 18 months using the results of the change in ADAS-cog 11 by tertiles of age groups.

RESULTS: Older age at baseline was associated with a slower rate of decline in the ADAS-cog 11 and the Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Almost twice as many subjects aged 80 years and older compared with those aged younger than 70 years would be required to demonstrate a 30{\%} treatment effect on the ADAS-cog 11 in an 18-month AD trial.

CONCLUSION: Subject age is an important factor to consider when defining the study population in and analyzing data from AD trials of potential disease-modifying therapies.},

abstract = {During the last decade, many novel approaches for addressing multiplicity problems arising in clinical trials have been introduced in the literature. These approaches provide great flexibility in addressing given clinical trial objectives and yet maintain strong control of the familywise error rate. In this tutorial article, we review multiple testing strategies that are related to the following: (a) recycling local significance levels to test hierarchically ordered hypotheses; (b) adapting the significance level for testing a hypothesis to the findings of testing previous hypotheses within a given test sequence, also in view of certain consistency requirements; (c) grouping hypotheses into hierarchical families of hypotheses along with recycling the significance level between those families; and (d) graphical methods that permit repeated recycling of the significance level. These four different methodologies are related to each other, and we point out some connections as we describe and illustrate them. By contrasting the main features of these approaches, our objective is to help practicing statisticians to select an appropriate method for their applications. In this regard, we discuss how to apply some of these strategies to clinical trial settings and provide algorithms to calculate critical values and adjusted p-values for their use in practice. The methods are illustrated with several numerical examples.},

abstract = {When analyzing a 2 x 2 table, the two-sided Fisher's exact test and the usual exact confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio may give conflicting inferences; for example, the test rejects but the associated CI contains an odds ratio of 1. The problem is that the usual exact CI is the inversion of the test that rejects if either of the one-sided Fisher's exact tests rejects at half the nominal significance level. Further, the confidence set that is the inversion of the usual two-sided Fisher's exact test may not be an interval, so following Blaker (2000, Confidence curves and improved exact confidence intervals for discrete distributions. Canadian Journal of Statistics 28, 783-798), we define the "matching" interval as the smallest interval that contains the confidence set. We explore these 2 versions of Fisher's exact test as well as an exact test suggested by Blaker (2000) and provide the R package exact2x2 which automatically assigns the appropriate matching interval to each of the 3 exact tests.},

abstract = {Transection of the adult rat dorsal fornix and fimbria (F-F) induced a sensitivity of the cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and diagonal band (MS/DB) to exogenous mouse nerve growth factor (mNGF). Continuous infusion of mNGF for two weeks after complete unilateral F-F aspiration resulted in a stimulation of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-specific activity in precise micro-dissections of the MS/DB ipsilateral to the transection to a level that was 200{\%} higher than that measured in normal adult animals. This supranormal stimulation of ChAT activity reached plateau levels after 10 days of NGF infusion and was dose-dependent with an E.D.50 equal to 120 ng/day. Administration of mNGF had no effect on the ChAT activity in the MS/DB of normal animals or animals with a unilateral transection of only the supracallosal dorsal septo-hippocampal pathway. Partial transection experiments indicated that a predominent pathway for cholinergic neurons potentially sensitive to exogenous mNGF runs in the paramedian F-F. Administration of mNGF also induced a stimulation of ChAT activity in dissections of the caudate-putamen both ipsi- and contralateral to the infusion cannula. This indicates that unlike the cholinergic projection neurons of the MS/DB, adult cholinergic striatal interneurons are sensitive to exogenous NGF without prior axotomy.},

abstract = {Administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) by intracerebroventricular infusion or transplantation of NGF-secreting cells to the basal forebrain improves spatial memory in aged animals. Using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector system, basal forebrain neurons were transduced to produce NGF ectopically for long intervals (at least 9 months). Rats received intraseptal injections of either the control vector, pTR-UF4, or the pTR-NGFmyc at 3 months of age, prior to testing their performance in the Morris water task. An age-related decrease in the acquisition of the hidden platform location was found at 12 months of age in the pTR-UF4 control group, but not in the pTR-NGFmyc group. Further, when compared to 3 month old untreated animals, the control group, but not the pTR-NGFmyc group, was impaired at 12 months of age. Concomitant to preventing age-related memory deficits, the NGF gene transfer increased cholinergic neuron size by 34{\%} in the medial septum. This approach may therefore represent a viable therapy for age-related dementia involving dysfunction in cholinergic activity and memory, such as Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Motivation Diseases that progress slowly are often studied by observing cohorts at different stages of disease for short periods of time. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) follows elders with various degrees of cognitive impairment, from normal to impaired. The study includes a rich panel of novel cognitive tests, biomarkers, and brain images collected every 6 months for as long as 6 years. The relative timing of the observations with respect to disease pathology is unknown. We propose a general semiparametric model and iterative estimation procedure to estimate simultaneously the pathological timing and long-term growth curves. The resulting estimates of long-term progression are fine-tuned using cognitive trajectories derived from the long-term "Personnes Ag{\'{e}}es Quid" study.
Results We demonstrate with simulations that the method can recover long-term disease trends from short-term observations. The method also estimates temporal ordering of individuals with respect to disease pathology, providing subject-specific prognostic estimates of the time until onset of symptoms. When the method is applied to ADNI data, the estimated growth curves are in general agreement with prevailing theories of the Alzheimer's disease cascade. Other data sets with common outcome measures can be combined using the proposed algorithm.
Availability Software to fit the model and reproduce results with the statistical software R is available as the grace package. ADNI data can be downloaded from the Laboratory of NeuroImaging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) celecoxib and rofecoxib (before its removal) are marketed as having fewer gastrointestinal (GI)-related complications than nonselective NSAIDs. However, adverse reaction data suggest that the use of COX-2 selective NSAIDs is associated with clinically significant GI events. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients receiving celecoxib and rofecoxib have a greater underlying disease burden than patients prescribed nonselective NSAIDs. METHODS: The study population consisted of members of 11 health plans, aged {\textgreater}34 years, with a pharmacy claim for celecoxib or rofecoxib or a nonselective NSAID dispensed between February 1, 1999, and July 31, 2001, who had been continuously enrolled for {\textgreater}364 days before the dispensing date. Celecoxib and rofecoxib patients were randomly selected without replacement from a pool of eligible users in each of the 30 months. Nonselective NSAID users were randomly chosen without replacement within each month on a 2:1 ratio to cases; they could be chosen in more than one month. Univariate analyses comparing 9000 cases and 18 000 controls were performed, followed by a multiple logistic regression analysis conditioned on time. RESULTS: Increasing age, treatment by a rheumatologist or an orthopedic specialist, treatment with a high number of different medications in the past year, treatment with oral corticosteroids in the past year, and having had a previous GI bleed increased the likelihood of receiving celecoxib or rofecoxib, whereas treatment with a high number of nonselective NSAID prescriptions in the past year decreased it. Treatment with a high number of different medications was a predictor of increased prevalence of underlying diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients having a greater underlying disease burden were more likely to receive COX-2 selective NSAIDs than nonselective ones. Paradoxically, patients at higher risk for cardiovascular disease were channeled toward treatment with COX-2 selective NSAIDs, many of which may confer an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and other adverse cardiovascular outcomes.},

@article{Edland2017,
abstract = {Introduction Composite scales have recently been proposed as outcome measures for clinical trials. For example, the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) is the sum of z-score normed component measures assessing episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. Alternative methods of calculating composite total scores using the weighted sum of the component measures that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting composite score have been proposed. Optimal weights can be estimated from pilot data, but it is an open question how large a pilot trial is required to calculate reliably optimal weights. Methods We describe the calculation of optimal weights and use large-scale computer simulations to investigate the question as how large a pilot study sample is required to inform the calculation of optimal weights. The simulations are informed by the pattern of decline observed in cognitively normal subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Prevention Instrument cohort study, restricting to n = 75 subjects aged 75 years and older with an APOE $\epsilon$4 risk allele and therefore likely to have an underlying Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative process. Results In the context of secondary prevention trials in Alzheimer's disease and using the components of the PACC, we found that pilot studies as small as 100 are sufficient to meaningfully inform weighting parameters. Regardless of the pilot study sample size used to inform weights, the optimally weighted PACC consistently outperformed the standard PACC in terms of statistical power to detect treatment effects in a clinical trial. Pilot studies of size 300 produced weights that achieved near-optimal statistical power and reduced required sample size relative to the standard PACC by more than half. Discussion These simulations suggest that modestly sized pilot studies, comparable to that of a phase 2 clinical trial, are sufficient to inform the construction of composite outcome measures. Although these findings apply only to the PACC in the context of prodromal Alzheimer's disease, the observation that weights only have to approximate the optimal weights to achieve near-optimal performance should generalize. Performing a pilot study or phase 2 trial to inform the weighting of proposed composite outcome measures is highly cost-effective. The net effect of more efficient outcome measures is that smaller trials will be required to test novel treatments. Alternatively, second generation trials can use prior clinical trial data to inform weighting, so that greater efficiency can be achieved as we move forward.},

abstract = {Although beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are a primary diagnostic criterion for Alzheimer's disease, this pathology is commonly observed in the brains of non-demented older individuals. To explore the importance of this pathology in the absence of dementia, we compared levels of amyloid deposition (via 'Pittsburgh Compound-B' (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging) to hippocampus volume (HV) and episodic memory (EM) in three groups: (i) normal controls (NC) from the Berkeley Aging Cohort (BAC NC, n = 20); (ii) normal controls (NC) from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI NC, n = 17); and (iii) PIB+ mild cognitive impairment subjects from the ADNI (ADNI PIB+ MCI, n = 39). Age, gender and education were controlled for in each statistical model, and HV was adjusted for intracranial volume (aHV). In BAC NC, elevated PIB uptake was significantly associated with smaller aHV (P = 0.0016) and worse EM (P = 0.0086). Within ADNI NC, elevated PIB uptake was significantly associated with smaller aHV (P = 0.047) but not EM (P = 0.60); within ADNI PIB+ MCI, elevated PIB uptake was significantly associated with both smaller aHV (P = 0.00070) and worse EM (P = 0.046). To further understand these relationships, a recursive regression procedure was conducted within all ADNI NC and PIB+ MCI subjects (n = 56) to test the hypothesis that HV mediates the relationship between Abeta and EM. Significant correlations were found between PIB index and EM (P = 0.0044), PIB index and aHV (P {\textless} 0.0001), as well as between aHV and EM (P {\textless} 0.0001). When both aHV and PIB were included in the same model to predict EM, aHV remained significant (P = 0.0015) whereas PIB index was no longer significantly associated with EM (P = 0.50). These results are consistent with a model in which Abeta deposition, hippocampal atrophy, and EM occur sequentially in elderly subjects, with Abeta deposition as the primary event in this cascade. This pattern suggests that declining EM in older individuals may be caused by Abeta-induced hippocampus atrophy.},

abstract = {Re-randomization test has been considered as a robust alternative to the traditional population model-based methods for analyzing randomized clinical trials. This is especially so when the clinical trials are randomized according to minimization, which is a popular covariate-adaptive randomization method for ensuring balance among prognostic factors. Among various re-randomization tests, fixed-entry-order re-randomization is advocated as an effective strategy when a temporal trend is suspected. Yet when the minimization is applied to trials with unequal allocation, fixed-entry-order re-randomization test is biased and thus compromised in power. We find that the bias is due to non-uniform re-allocation probabilities incurred by the re-randomization in this case. We therefore propose a weighted fixed-entry-order re-randomization test to overcome the bias. The performance of the new test was investigated in simulation studies that mimic the settings of a real clinical trial. The weighted re-randomization test was found to work well in the scenarios investigated including the presence of a strong temporal trend.},

abstract = {Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is based on the results of neuropsychological tests and available supporting biomarkers such as the results of imaging studies. The results of the tests and the values of biomarkers are dependent on the nuisance features, such as age and gender. In order to improve diagnostic power, the effects of the nuisance features have to be removed from the data. In this paper, four types of interactions between classification features and nuisance features were identified. Three methods were tested to remove these interactions from the classification data. In stratified analysis, a homogeneous subgroup was generated from a training set. Data correction method utilized linear regression model to remove the effects of nuisance features from data. The third method was a combination of these two methods. The methods were tested using all the baseline data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database in two classification studies: classifying control subjects from Alzheimer's disease patients and discriminating stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment subjects. The results show that both stratified analysis and data correction are able to statistically significantly improve the classification accuracy of several neuropsychological tests and imaging biomarkers. The improvements were especially large for the classification of stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment subjects, where the best improvements observed were 6{\%} units. The data correction method gave better results for imaging biomarkers, whereas stratified analysis worked well with the neuropsychological tests. In conclusion, the study shows that the excess variability caused by nuisance features should be removed from the data to improve the classification accuracy, and therefore, the reliability of diagnosis making.},

abstract = {It is generally recognized that more sensitive instruments for the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed. The integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) combines scores from 2 widely accepted measures, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL). Disease progression and treatment differences as measured by the iADRS were analyzed using data from solanezumab EXPEDITION, EXPEDITION2, and EXPEDITION-EXT Studies; semagacestat IDENTITY Study; and donepezil ADCS – mild cognitive impairment (ADCS-MCI) Study. Psychometric properties of the iADRS were established through principal component analysis (PCA) and estimation of contributions of subscores and individual item scores to the iADRS total score. The iADRS performed better than most composites and scales in detecting disease progression and comparably or better than individual scales in detecting treatment differences. PCA demonstrated the iADRS can be divided into two principal components primarily representing cognitive items and instrumental ADLs. Dynamic ranges of the subscales were similar across all studies, reflecting approximately equal contributions from both subscales to the iADRS total score. In item analyses, every item contributed to the total score, with varying strength of contributions by item and across data sets. The iADRS demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and was effective in capturing disease progression from MCI through moderate AD and treatment effects across the early disease spectrum. These findings suggest the iADRS can be used in studies of mixed populations, ensuring sensitivity to treatment effects as subjects progress during studies of putative disease-modifying agents.

In the context of treatment benefit, an estimand may address either efficacy or effectiveness aspects. Defining the estimand of interest is an essential step to take before deciding on trial design and primary analysis. The choice of estimand has consequences for various other factors to be considered during any clinical trial's planning phase. This study presents a process chart including all aspects to consider during planning. After deciding on the primary estimand, the trial design should be specified, followed by the primary analysis. Both should appropriately address the chosen estimand. Finally, sensitivity analyses should be taken into account. Provided are suggestions for all the planning steps involved, especially on choosing between efficacy and effectiveness, and relevant examples from clinical practice to illustrate them. It is recommended that one bear in mind the process chart during planning of any clinical trial and give reasonable justification for each decision in the study protocol.},

abstract = {Despite enormous financial and scientific efforts, still no approved disease-modifying therapies exist for Alzheimer's disease (AD). During the last decade all Phase III clinical trials on disease modifiers in AD have failed. The dementia stage of AD being probably too late in order to allow for successful disease modification has been identified as a possible culprit that could explain the failure of so many clinical trials. In parallel, a major development in the diagnostic research field of AD was achieved by the recent proposal of new diagnostic criteria for AD, which also specifically incorporate the use of biomarkers as defining criteria for preclinical stages of AD, thus extending the traditional definition of disease to very early stages that may be a more feasible target for various disease modifying therapeutic interventions. This ongoing paradigm shift in AD definition and diagnosis represents a fundamental basis for redefinition of interventional trials in AD, allowing to specifically focus on preventative measures during very early pathophysiologically confirmed stages of disease. This consensus paper reflects the outcome from a European Union and North American Task Force meeting comprised of experts from academia, industry, private foundations, and regulatory agencies that was convened in Toulouse, France on November 5, 2010 and that focused on prevention trials in AD. This position paper thoroughly analyzes prerequisites for successful preventative trials in AD and concludes with concrete recommendations on biomarkers, statistical tools and other variables important for improved study designs suitable for preventative as well as for early therapeutic interventional trials in AD.},

abstract = {Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of an elevated burden of amyloid plaques in the brain. The predominant component of these plaques is Abeta protein, particularly a 42-amino acid isoform (Abetal-42) that is derived from a larger amyloid precursor protein. The hypothesis underlying this program is that administration of an antibody against Abeta will reduce the formation or mediate the removal of plaque, in patients with AD and lead to a beneficial clinical effect. Bapineuzumab is a humanized anti-amyloid- beta monoclonal antibody in development for the treatment of AD. Bapineuzumab, given intravenously (IV), is being evaluated in a phase 3 clinical trial program designed to evaluate its efficacy as a potential disease modifier based on a combination of clinical and biomarker evidence. Separate trials have been designed for apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele carriers and non-carriers as phase 2 data suggested possible safety differences between these populations. Objectives: The objective of this session is to present results from two randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies of bapinueuzumab IV in AD patients who are APOE e4 carriers and non-carriers. Discussion: These two studies randomized and dosed over 2,000 AD patients with mild to moderate dementia (MMSE 16-26). Following a 6 week screening period, patients received either bapineuzumab (0.5mg/kg) or placebo by IV infusion every 13 weeks and were followed until study endpoint at 78 weeks. The co-primary clinical endpoints are change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS- Cog) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) at week 78. Biomarker substudies assessing effects of bapineuzumab on PiB-PET brain amyloid burden, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau, and brain volume were included. Statistical analyses will be performed to estimate treatment differences at study endpoint through mixed models for repeated measures and analysis of covariance. ADAS-Cog, DAD, and biomarker endpoints (PiB PET, CSF phospho-tau, volumetric MRI) as well as safety data will be presented. Conclusion: These clinical trials are designed to provide a robust evaluation of the efficacy and safety of bapineuzumab in AD patients with mild to moderate dementia who are APOE e4 carriers and APOE e4 noncarriers.},

We quantify the variation in the response that is explained by the covariates under the linear mixed model, and study three types of measures to estimate such quantities. The first type of measures make direct use of the estimated variances; the second type of measures use residual sums of squares in analogy to the linear regression; the third type of measures are based on the Kullback-Leibler information gain. All the measures can be easily obtained from software programs that fit linear mixed models. We study the performance of the measures through Monte Carlo simulations, and illustrate the usefulness of the measures on data sets.},

abstract = {Incomplete multi-level data arise commonly in many clinical trials and observational studies. Because of multi-level variations in this type of data, appropriate data analysis should take these variations into account. A random effects model can allow for the multi-level variations by assuming random effects at each level, but the computation is intensive because high-dimensional integrations are often involved in fitting models. Marginal methods such as the inverse probability weighted generalized estimating equations can involve simple estimation computation, but it is hard to specify the working correlation matrix for multi-level data. In this paper, we introduce a latent variable method to deal with incomplete multi-level data when the missing mechanism is missing at random, which fills the gap between the random effects model and marginal models. Latent variable models are built for both the response and missing data processes to incorporate the variations that arise at each level. Simulation studies demonstrate that this method performs well in various situations. We apply the proposed method to an Alzheimer's disease study.},

abstract = {L{\'{e}}vy processes have been receiving increasing attention in financial modeling. One distinctive feature of such models is that their characteristic functions are readily available. Inference based on characteristic functions is very useful for studying Levy processes. By incorporating the recent advances in nonparametric approaches, empirical likelihood methods based on characteristic functions are developed in this paper for parameter estimation, testing a particular parametric class including the presence of a jump component in the Levy process and testing for symmetry of a distribution. Simulation and case studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {A continuous quality improvement approach is proposed for the assessment and management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on scores on a one-page patient self-report multidimensional health assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ), without formal joint counts. The approach includes five simple steps before the patient is seen by the physician: (1) an MDHAQ is completed by every patient at every visit; (2) scores are calculated for patient function, pain, and global estimate, with options for a self-report joint count and other scales; (3) scores are entered on flow sheets with data from prior visits, which might also include laboratory and medication information; (4) scores are compiled into an index termed Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID), analogous to a Disease Activity Score (DAS); (5) RAPID scores are classified to guide treatment decisions. RAPID 3 includes the three patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in the RA Core Data Set - physical function, pain, and global estimate. RAPID 4 adds a self-report joint count, and RAPID 5, a physician global estimate. RAPID 3 can be calculated in about 10 seconds, RAPID 4 in about 19 seconds, and RAPID 5 in about 20 seconds. RAPID 3, RAPID 4, and RAPID 5 give similar results to distinguish active from control treatments in RA clinical trials, at levels similar to American College of Rheumatology or DAS improvement criteria, and are all correlated significantly with DAS28 (rho=0.62-0.64, P{\textless}0.001). A proposed classification of RAPID scores, analogous to four DAS28 categories, includes: 'near remission' (0-1), 'low severity' (1.01-2), 'moderate severity' (2.01-4), and 'high severity' ({\textgreater}4). RAPID scoring is feasible in standard clinical care to support continuous quality improvement.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify a cognitive composite that is sensitive to tracking preclinical Alzheimer's disease decline to be used as a primary end point in treatment trials. METHOD: We capitalized on longitudinal data collected from 1995 to 2010 from cognitively unimpaired presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers from the world's largest known early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease kindred to identify a composite cognitive test with the greatest statistical power to track preclinical Alzheimer's disease decline and estimate the number of carriers age 30 years and older needed to detect a treatment effect in the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative's (API) preclinical Alzheimer's disease treatment trial. The mean-to-standard-deviation ratios (MSDRs) of change over time were calculated in a search for the optimal combination of 1 to 7 cognitive tests/subtests drawn from the neuropsychological test battery in cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers during a 2- and 5-year follow-up period (n = 78 and 57), using data from noncarriers (n = 31 and 56) during the same time period to correct for aging and practice effects. Combinations that performed well were then evaluated for robustness across follow-up years, occurrence of selected items within top-performing combinations, and representation of relevant cognitive domains. RESULTS: The optimal test combination included Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word List Recall, CERAD Boston Naming Test (high frequency items), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Orientation to Time, CERAD Constructional Praxis, and Raven's Progressive Matrices (Set A), with an MSDR of 1.62. This composite is more sensitive than using either the CERAD Word List Recall (MSDR = 0.38) or the entire CERAD-Col battery (MSDR = 0.76). A sample size of 75 cognitively normal PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers aged 30 years and older per treatment arm allows for a detectable treatment effect of 29{\%} in a 60-month trial (80{\%} power, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a composite cognitive test score representing multiple cognitive domains that, compared to the most sensitive single test item, has improved power to track preclinical Alzheimer's disease decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers and to evaluate preclinical Alzheimer's disease treatments. This API composite cognitive test score will be used as the primary end point in the first API trial in cognitively unimpaired autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease carriers within 15 years of their estimated age at clinical onset. We have independently confirmed our findings in a separate cohort of cognitively healthy older adults who progressed to the clinical stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, described in a separate report, and continue to refine the composite in independent cohorts and compared with other analytic approaches.},

Today, no standardized computational tools exist for the analysis of LNI data and widely used methods are sub-optimal for the types of data encountered in real-life studies. Linear Mixed Effects (LME) modeling, a mature approach well known in the statistics community, offers a powerful and versatile framework for analyzing real-life LNI data. This article presents the theory behind LME models, contrasts it with other popular approaches in the context of LNI, and is accompanied with an array of computational tools that will be made freely available through FreeSurfer - a popular Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis software package.Our core contribution is to provide a quantitative empirical evaluation of the performance of LME and competing alternatives popularly used in prior longitudinal structural MRI studies, namely repeated measures ANOVA and the analysis of annualized longitudinal change measures (e.g. atrophy rate). In our experiments, we analyzed MRI-derived longitudinal hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness measurements from a public dataset consisting of Alzheimer's patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Our results suggest that the LME approach offers superior statistical power in detecting longitudinal group differences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background There is growing interest in the evaluation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments. As a result, there is a need to identify a cognitive composite that is sensitive to track preclinical AD decline to be used as a primary endpoint in treatment trials. Methods Longitudinal data from initially cognitively normal, 70- to 85-year-old participants in three cohort studies of aging and dementia from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center were examined to empirically define a composite cognitive endpoint that is sensitive to detect and track cognitive decline before the onset of cognitive impairment. The mean-to-standard deviation ratios (MSDRs) of change over time were calculated in a search for the optimal combination of cognitive tests/subtests drawn from the neuropsychological battery in cognitively normal participants who subsequently progressed to clinical stages of AD during 2- and 5-year periods, using data from those who remained unimpaired during the same period to correct for aging and practice effects. Combinations that performed well were then evaluated for representation of relevant cognitive domains, robustness across individual years before diagnosis, and occurrence of selected items within top performing combinations. Results The optimal composite cognitive test score comprised seven cognitive tests/subtests with an MSDR = 0.964. By comparison, the most sensitive individual test score was Logical Memory Delayed Recall with an MSDR = 0.64. Conclusions We have identified a composite cognitive test score representing multiple cognitive domains that has improved power compared with the most sensitive single test item to track preclinical AD decline and evaluate preclinical AD treatments. We are confirming the power of the composite in independent cohorts and with other analytical approaches, which may result in refinements, have designated it as the primary endpoint in the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative's preclinical treatment trials for individuals at high imminent risk for developing symptoms due to late-onset AD.},

abstract = {Fibrillar deposits of highly phosphorylated tau are a key pathological feature of several neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and some frontotemporal dementias. Increasing evidence suggests that the presence of these end-stage neurofibrillary lesions do not cause neuronal loss, but rather that alterations to soluble tau proteins induce neurodegeneration. In particular, aberrant tau phosphorylation is acknowledged to be a key disease process, influencing tau structure, distribution, and function in neurons. Although typically described as a cytosolic protein that associates with microtubules and regulates axonal transport, several additional functions of tau have recently been demonstrated, including roles in DNA stabilization, and synaptic function. Most recently, studies examining the trans-synaptic spread of tau pathology in disease models have suggested a potential role for extracellular tau in cell signaling pathways intrinsic to neurodegeneration. Here we review the evidence showing that tau phosphorylation plays a key role in neurodegenerative tauopathies. We also comment on the tractability of altering phosphorylation-dependent tau functions for therapeutic intervention in AD and related disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many randomized trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at baseline and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between baseline and post-treatment; percentage change between baseline and post-treatment and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between baseline and post-treatment scores. RESULTS: ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from baseline has acceptable power when correlation between baseline and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from baseline has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from baseline will also fail to protect from bias in the case of baseline imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage change from baseline should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores.},

abstract = {Recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) was delivered for up to 6 months by continuous intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion to CD (Sprague-Dawley derived) rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Rats (n = 15/sex/group) received doses of 0 (vehicle), 6, 60, or 300 ng/day; monkeys (n = 5/sex/group) received 0, 0.6, 6, or 60 microg/day of rhNGF. Animals tolerated i.c.v. infusion with no behavioral signs attributable to rhNGF. Body weight was transiently decreased in female rats at the highest dose. At the completion of dosing, histological examination in both species revealed an increase in the thickness of the leptomeninges along the ventral and lateral surfaces of the hindbrain and extending over the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. The change was present to varying degrees at all doses of rhNGF and tended to be more severe at higher doses. At the light microscopic level, the leptomeninges contained layers of well-differentiated, spindle-shaped cells and a plexus of axonal fibers. Cells were immunoreactive for S-100 protein and were associated with an accumulation of Type IV collagen, suggesting Schwann cell origin. Electron microscopy revealed numerous fine caliber axons ensheathed by the presumptive Schwann cells, with myelination of individual axonal segments. These findings suggest that chronic i.c.v. delivery of rhNGF has stimulated axonal sprouting and secondary hyperplasia of Schwann or Schwann-like support cells within the pia-arachnoid.},

abstract = {Model-based statistical approaches were used to compare the ability of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers to predict 12-month progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer disease (AD). Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set, properties of the 11-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.11), the 13-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.All) and novel composite scores were compared, using weighting schemes derived from the Random Forests (RF) tree-based multivariate model. Weighting subscores using the RF model of ADAS.All enhanced discrimination between elderly controls, MCI and AD patients. The ability of the RF-weighted ADAS-cog composite and individual scores, along with neuroimaging or biochemical biomarkers to predict MCI to AD conversion over 12 months was also assessed. Although originally optimized to discriminate across diagnostic categories, the ADAS. All, weighted according to the RF model, did nearly as well or better than individual or composite baseline neuroimaging or CSF biomarkers in prediction of 12-month conversion from MCI to AD. These suggest that a modified subscore weighting scheme applied to the 13-item ADAS-cog is comparable to imaging or CSF markers in prediction of conversion from MCI to AD at 12 months.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Careful consideration of site effects is important in the analysis of multi-site clinical trials for drug abuse treatment. The statistical choices for modeling these effects have implications for both trial planning and interpretation of findings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: Three broad approaches for modeling site effects are presented: omitting site from the analysis; modeling site as a fixed effect; and modeling site as a random effect. Both the direct effect of site and the interaction of site and treatment are considered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The statistical model, and consequences, for each approach are presented along with examples from existing clinical trials. Power analysis calculations provide sample size requirements for adequate statistical power for studies utilizing 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 treatment sites.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results of the power analyses showed that the total sample required falls rapidly as the number of sites increases in the random effect approach. In the fixed effect approach in which the interaction of site and treatment is considered, the required number of participants per site decreases as the number of sites increases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Ignoring site effects is not a viable option in multi-site clinical trials. There are advantages and disadvantages to the fixed effect and random effect approaches to modeling site effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: The distinction between efficacy trials and effectiveness trials is rarely sharp. The choice between random effect and fixed effect statistical modeling can provide different benefits depending on the goals of the study.},

Power and sample size requirements depend on the pattern of treatment effects and the pattern of correlations among the repeated measurements, as well as on parameters common to sample size estimation for cross-sectional comparisons of treatment effects in simple randomized designs. Simplifying assumptions permit generation of these numerous parameter estimates from predictions of the magnitude of the standardized "effect size" at end of trial and the single correlation between the baseline and endpoint measurements. Monte Carlo methods are used to verify the actual power of different tests of significance for treatment effects in repeated measurement designs using sample sizes estimated by the formulas.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In randomized controlled trials with many potential prognostic factors, serious imbalance among treatment groups regarding these factors can occur. Minimization methods can improve balance but increase the possibility of selection bias. We described and evaluated the performance of a new method of treatment allocation, called studywise minimization, that can avoid imbalance by chance and reduce selection bias.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The studywise minimization algorithm consists of three steps: (1) calculate the imbalance for all possible allocations, (2) list all allocations with minimum imbalance, and (3) randomly select one of the allocations with minimum imbalance. We carried out a simulation study to compare the performance of studywise minimization with three other allocation methods: randomization, biased-coin minimization, and deterministic minimization. Performance was measured, calculating maximal and average imbalance as a percentage of the group size.

RESULTS: Independent of trial size and number of prognostic factors, the risk of serious imbalance was the highest in randomization and absent in studywise minimization. The largest differences among the allocation methods regarding the risk of imbalance were found in small trials.

CONCLUSION: Studywise minimization is particularly useful in small trials, where it eliminates the risk of serious imbalances without generating the occurrence of selection bias.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist used to treat asthma, and to discuss the therapeutic role of montelukast as long-term medication and difficulties associated with the management of asthma.

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (up to May 1999) was conducted to identify relevant English-language publications, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, and recent reviews.

STUDY SELECTION: All available published reports of controlled, clinical trials of montelukast in adults and children with asthma were summarized, including pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic effects of montelukast.

DATA EXTRACTION: Information on the safety and efficacy of montelukast was evaluated on the basis of patient selection, study design, methodology, and statistical significance as compared with placebo or inhaled corticosteroid treatment.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Montelukast is approved for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma at a dose of 10 mg once daily for adolescents ({\textgreater} or =15 y) and adults and 5 mg once daily for children (6-14 y). In placebo-controlled clinical trials, montelukast significantly improved pulmonary lung function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 sec), significantly reduced beta2-agonist use, and significantly improved patient-reported end points in adults and children ({\textgreater} or =6 y) with chronic asthma. In adults, a similar magnitude of improvement in lung function is seen with or without inhaled corticosteroid use; the effects of montelukast may be additive to those of inhaled corticosteroids and permit the reduction of the required dose of inhaled corticosteroids. In cases of exercise-induced asthma (adults and children), montelukast treatment attenuates the fall in pulmonary function following exercise. It attenuates both the early- and late-phase responses of asthma after allergen inhalation. Improvements in asthma control are similar in asthmatic patients who are aspirin-sensitive or not aspirin-sensitive and can be seen within one day of treatment. Tolerance does not develop, and the adverse events do not differ from those of placebo.

CONCLUSIONS: Montelukast is indicated for the prophylaxis of chronic asthma in adults and children ({\textgreater} or =6 y). It may be considered for use as first-line therapy in patients with mild persistent asthma or for additional control in patients who are still symptomatic while receiving treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. It may also be used for additional control in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients. Consideration may be given for using montelukast to allow tapering of the dose of inhaled corticosteroids while maintaining clinical stability. Chronic treatment with montelukast can provide additional control of symptoms during exercise, but inhaled beta2-agonists remain first-line therapy for prophylaxis and treatment.},

abstract = {Screening and tracking subjects and data management in clinical trials require significant investments in manpower that can be reduced through the use of web-based systems. To support a validation trial of various dietary assessment tools that required multiple clinic visits and eight repeats of online assessments, we developed an interactive web-based system to automate all levels of management of a biomarker-based clinical trial. The "Energetics System" was developed to support 1) the work of the study coordinator in recruiting, screening and tracking subject flow, 2) the need of the principal investigator to review study progress, and 3) continuous data analysis. The system was designed to automate web-based self-screening into the trial. It supported scheduling tasks and triggered tailored messaging for late and non-responders. For the investigators, it provided real-time status overviews on all subjects, created electronic case reports, supported data queries and prepared analytic data files. Encryption and multi-level password protection were used to insure data privacy. The system was programmed iteratively and required six months of a web programmer's time along with active team engagement. In this study the enhancement in speed and efficiency of recruitment and quality of data collection as a result of this system outweighed the initial investment. Web-based systems have the potential to streamline the process of recruitment and day-to-day management of clinical trials in addition to improving efficiency and quality. Because of their added value they should be considered for trials of moderate size or complexity.},

abstract = {In longitudinal clinical trials for drug development, the study objective is often to evaluate overall treatment effect across all visits. Despite careful planning and study conduct, the occurrence of incomplete data cannot be completely eliminated. As a direct likelihood method, the mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) has become one of the preferred approaches for handling missing data in such designs. MMRM is a full multivariate model in nature, which avoids potential bias as a predetermined model, and operates in a more general missing-at-random (MAR) framework. However, if treatment effect is constant over time, overparameterization of treatment by time interaction in MMRM could result in loss of power. In this article, we utilize MMRM estimates and propose an optimal weighting method for combining visit-specific estimates to maximize the power under MAR mechanism. For a special case where the underlying covariance is compound symmetry, we show that the optimal weighting method is asymptotically equal to MMRM. In other words, MMRM has optimal power under this special case. When the underlying covariance is of an unstructured pattern, the optimal weighting method has increased power under MAR and missing-not-at-random (MNAR) mechanisms, and can lead to bias reduction under MNAR. This is especially true when the variance is greater at later time point, which could lead to a smaller weight. We present practical examples using the optimal weighting method to analyze two cystic fibrosis clinical trial data sets.},

abstract = {Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors effectively interfere with the renin-angiotensin system and exert various beneficial actions on vascular structure and function beyond their blood pressure-lowering effects. Zofenopril, a potent sulphydryl ACE inhibitor, is characterized by high lipophilicity, sustained cardiac ACE inhibition, and antioxidant and tissue protective activities. Its ancillary properties, such as antioxidant activity and cardiovascular (CV) protection, make this drug potentially suitable for the treatment and prevention of certain CV diseases. The Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long term Evaluation trials have demonstrated that the early administration of zofenopril to patients with acute myocardial infarction is associated with a significant reduction in the 6-week occurrence of major CV events in high-risk patients with anterior non-thrombolyzed myocardial infarction. The fixed combination of zofenopril-hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 30/12.5 mg/day is approved for the management of mild-to-moderate hypertension in different European countries. In clinical trials comparing zofenopril-HCTZ with each agent administered as monotherapy, combination therapy was clearly more effective in normalizing blood pressure (BP). In addition, combination therapy provided sustained and consistent BP control over the entire 24 hour dosing interval. The efficacy and safety profile of zofenopril-HCTZ highlights that this combination is a potentially useful addition to currently available therapy for patients with BP inadequately controlled by monotherapy, as well as for patients who require more rapid and intensive BP control.},

METHODS: The numbers of individuals in the United States with Alzheimer's disease and the numbers of newly diagnosed cases that can be expected over the next 50 years were estimated from a model that used age-specific incidence rates summarized from several epidemiological studies, US mortality rates, and US Bureau of the Census projections. RESULTS: in 1997, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States was 2.32 million (range: 1.09 to 4.58 million); of these individuals, 68{\%} were female. It is projected that the prevalence will nearly quadruple in the next 50 years, by which time approximately 1 in 45 Americans will be afflicted with the disease. Currently, the annual number of new incident cases in 360,000. If interventions could delay onset of the disease by 2 years, after 50 years there would be nearly 2 million fewer cases than projected; if onset could be delayed by 1 year, there would be nearly 800,000 fewer prevalent cases. CONCLUSIONS: As the US population ages, Alzheimer's disease will become an enormous public health problem. interventions that could delay disease onset even modestly would have a major public health impact.},

abstract = {Clinical trial outcomes for Alzheimer's disease are typically analyzed by using the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) or similar models that compare an efficacy scale change from baseline between treatment arms with or without participants' disease stage as a covariate. The MMRM focuses on a single-point fixed follow-up duration regardless of the exposure for each participant. In contrast to these typical models, we have developed a novel semiparametric cognitive disease progression model (DPM) for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease based on the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study. This model includes 3 novel features, in which the DPM (1) aligns and compares participants by disease stage, (2) uses a proportional treatment effect similar to the concept of the Cox proportional hazard ratio, and (3) incorporates extended follow-up data from participants with different follow-up durations using all data until last participant visit. We present the DPM model developed by using the DIAN observational study data and demonstrate through simulation that the cognitive DPM used in hypothetical intervention clinical trials produces substantial gains in power compared with the MMRM.},

abstract = {Regulatory guidelines for drug development suggest a strong control of the familywise error rate, when multiple hypotheses are simultaneously tested in confirmatory clinical trials. Accordingly, a variety of multiple test procedures exist for pharmaceutical trial applications, which are typically defined on a single structured family of null hypotheses. For some confirmatory clinical trials with multiple objectives, however, it is advantageous to address the arising multiplicity problems via grouped families of hypotheses. Graphical test procedures have been developed to construct, visualize, and perform multiple test procedures that are tailored to either a single or multiple families of structured hypotheses of interest. This note complements the existing literature by introducing a general algorithm to calculate adjusted p-values for any sequentially rejective graphical test procedure where the test procedures within the individual families of hypotheses are not necessarily graphical.},

abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are important for early diagnosis in routine clinical practice and research. Three core CSF biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (A$\beta$42, T-tau, and P-tau) have been assessed in numerous studies, and several other Alzheimer's disease markers are emerging in the literature. However, there have been no comprehensive meta-analyses of their diagnostic performance. We systematically reviewed the literature for 15 biomarkers in both CSF and blood to assess which of these were most altered in Alzheimer's disease. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we screened PubMed and Web of Science for articles published between July 1, 1984, and June 30, 2014, about CSF and blood biomarkers reflecting neurodegeneration (T-tau, NFL, NSE, VLP-1, and HFABP), APP metabolism (A$\beta$42, A$\beta$40, A$\beta$38, sAPP$\alpha$, and sAPP$\beta$), tangle pathology (P-tau), blood–brain-barrier function (albumin ratio), and glial activation (YKL-40, MCP-1, and GFAP). Data were taken from cross-sectional cohort studies as well as from baseline measurements in longitudinal studies with clinical follow-up. Articles were excluded if they did not contain a cohort with Alzheimer's disease and a control cohort, or a cohort with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and a stable mild cognitive impairment cohort. Data were extracted by ten authors and checked by two for accuracy. For quality assessment, modified QUADAS criteria were used. Biomarker performance was rated by random-effects meta-analysis based on the ratio between biomarker concentration in patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls (fold change) or the ratio between biomarker concentration in those with mild cognitive impariment due to Alzheimer's disease and those with stable mild cognitive impairment who had a follow-up time of at least 2 years and no further cognitive decline. Findings: Of 4521 records identified from PubMed and 624 from Web of Science, 231 articles comprising 15 699 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 13 018 controls were included in this analysis. The core biomarkers differentiated Alzheimer's disease from controls with good performance: CSF T-tau (average ratio 2{\textperiodcentered}54, 95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}44–2{\textperiodcentered}64, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), P-tau (1{\textperiodcentered}88, 1{\textperiodcentered}79–1{\textperiodcentered}97, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), and A$\beta$42 (0{\textperiodcentered}56, 0{\textperiodcentered}55–0{\textperiodcentered}58, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Differentiation between cohorts with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and those with stable mild cognitive impairment was also strong (average ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}67 for CSF A$\beta$42, 1{\textperiodcentered}72 for P-tau, and 1{\textperiodcentered}76 for T-tau). Furthermore, CSF NFL (2{\textperiodcentered}35, 1{\textperiodcentered}90–2{\textperiodcentered}91, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and plasma T-tau (1{\textperiodcentered}95, 1{\textperiodcentered}12–3{\textperiodcentered}38, p=0{\textperiodcentered}02) had large effect sizes when differentiating between controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease, whereas those of CSF NSE, VLP-1, HFABP, and YKL-40 were moderate (average ratios 1{\textperiodcentered}28–1{\textperiodcentered}47). Other assessed biomarkers had only marginal effect sizes or did not differentiate between control and patient samples. Interpretation: The core CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration (T-tau, P-tau, and A$\beta$42), CSF NFL, and plasma T-tau were strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease and the core biomarkers were strongly associated with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Emerging CSF biomarkers NSE, VLP-1, HFABP, and YKL-40 were moderately associated with Alzheimer's disease, whereas plasma A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 were not. Due to their consistency, T-tau, P-tau, A$\beta$42, and NFL in CSF should be used in clinical practice and clinical research.

abstract = {Objectives: To examine whether the presence of domain-specific cognitive impairments would predict a response to donepezil medication in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: The protocol was an open-label study of 30 AD subjects (mean age 74 years; education 11 years; Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 23 of 30) beginning a 6-month course of treatment with donepezil. Global response to treatment was determined using a combination algorithm based on changes over 6 months in the ADAS-cog, MMSE and CIBIC. In addition, a set of neuropsychological and experimental cognitive tests designed to test five domains of cognition were administered before beginning therapy in order to determine which domain of testing would be predictive to response to treatment. The tests examined attention, short-term and working memory, learning and memory, visuo-spatial motor skills, and lexical-semantic knowledge. Results: Eighteen of the thirty subjects were rated as having responded (stable or improved scores on the combination algorithm) to the therapy. Responders were significantly less impaired prior to treatment on the following tests: the Clock Drawing Test, a Visual-Spatial Motor Tracking Test, and the Boston Picture Naming Test. No significant initial group differences were noted on the other neuropsychological or experimental cognitive measures. Conclusion: The tests that most reliably predicted response to donepezil in AD subjects were in the domains of visual-spatial motor abilities and lexical-semantic functioning.

The clusters of tissues so obtained in the first problem can play a useful role in the discovery and understanding of new subclasses of diseases. The clusters of genes obtained in the second problem can be used to search for genetic pathways or groups of genes that might be regulated together. Also, in the first problem, we may wish first to summarize the information in the very large number of genes by clustering them into groups (of hyperspherical shape), which can be represented by some metagenes, such as the group sample means. We can then carry out the clustering of the tissues in terms of these metagenes. We focus here on mixtures of normals to provide a model-based clustering of tissue samples (gene signatures) and of gene profiles.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The doubling time is the number of chronological years for the age-specific incidence rate to double in magnitude. Doubling times describe the rate of increase of the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with advancing age. Estimates of doubling times of AD assist in understanding disease etiology and forecasting future disease prevalence. The objective of this study was to investigate regional and gender differences in the doubling of AD age-specific incidence rates. METHODS: We identified all studies in the peer review literature that reported age-specific incidence rates for AD. We modeled the logarithm of the incidence rate as a linear function of age. We used both fixed effects models and random effects models to account for interstudy variation. RESULTS: AD incidence rates exponentially increase with increasing age. The overall estimate of the doubling time was 5.5 years. The doubling times from studies performed in North America and Europe were 6.0 and 5.8, respectively; whereas the doubling times in all other parts of the world were 5.0. There was no significant geographic differences in doubling times (P = .3). Although the doubling times were slightly longer for men (6.5 years) than for women (5.4 years), the difference was not significant (P = .3). CONCLUSIONS: Doubling times of AD incidence rates are not statistically significantly different among populations throughout the world. The risk of AD grows exponentially with age, doubling approximately every 5 to 6 years. Although the shapes of the incidence curves are similar, there is considerable variation in absolute incidence rates throughout the world. Currently, there are limited epidemiologic data at the oldest ages, and further study is needed to accurately define the incidence curve above age 90.},

The difference in decline rates for being in the top tertile of MIND diet scores versus the lowest was equivalent to being 7.5 years younger in age.

Risk factors for these various clinical changes, which we term "transitions," may provide targets for therapeutic interventions. Therefore, it is useful to develop new approaches to assess risk factors for these transitions. Markov models have been used to investigate the transient nature of MCI represented by amnestic single-domain and mixed MCI states, where mixed MCI comprised all other MCI subtypes based on cognitive assessments. The purpose of this study is to expand this risk model by including a clinically determined MCI state as an outcome. Analyses show that several common risk factors play different roles in affecting transitions to MCI and dementia. Notably, APOE-4 increases the risk of transition to clinical MCI but does not affect the risk for a final transition to dementia, and baseline hypertension decreases the risk of transition to dementia from clinical MCI.},

abstract = {Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (pAD) reflects neuropathological findings of AD in cognitively normal subjects. The present study represents an effort to determine if differences could be identified in the longitudinal patterns of cognitive performance in persons classified as pAD compared to those who did not meet criteria for AD at autopsy. We included 121 subjects who were cognitively normal from baseline through their last assessment before death and who underwent autopsy. Participants were classified into two groups: pathologically normal (PN; NIA-Reagan low or no-likelihood of AD, n = 89) and preclinical AD (pAD; NIA-Reagan criteria of intermediate or high-likelihood of AD in the absence of clinical dementia symptoms, n = 32) followed for a mean 7.5 years prior to death. Longitudinal rates and patterns of change in scores on a standard cognitive battery were compared between these two groups. While cognitive results at baseline and last evaluations revealed no clear cross sectional group differences after adjustment for age, ApoE status, education, and gender, statistically significant differences between the pAD and PN groups in slope of decline were seen on a composite score of cognitive function. Further analyses showed three components of this score reached significance: constructional praxis, delayed recall of a word list, and category verbal fluency. Despite being clinically viewed as normal at enrollment and at the final exam, there are significant differences in rates of cognitive decline in participants classified as pAD compared to those without this pathology. Longitudinal changes in slope of decline in specific cognitive test measures can serve as non-invasive methods for the detection of pAD.},

abstract = {When survival data are collected as part of a prevalent cohort study with follow-up, the recruited cases have already experienced their initiating event, say onset of a disease, and consequently the incidence process is only partially observed. Nevertheless, there are good reasons for interest in certain features of the underlying incidence process, for example whether or not it is stationary. Indeed, the well known relationship between incidence and prevalence, often used by epidemiologists, requires stationarity of the incidence rate for its validity. Also, the statistician can exploit stationarity of the incidence process by improving the efficiency of estimators in a prevalent cohort survival analysis. In addition, whether the incident rate is stationary is often in itself of central importance to medical and other researchers. We present here a necessary and sufficient condition for stationarity of the underlying incidence process, which uses only survival observations, possibly right censored, from a prevalent cohort study with follow-up. This leads to a simple graphical means of checking for the stationarity of the underlying incidence times by comparing the plots of two Kaplan-Meier estimates that are based on partially observed incidence times and follow-up survival data. We use our method to discuss the incidence rate of dementia in Canada between 1971 and 1991.},

abstract = {Visual cortical surface area varies two- to threefold between human individuals, is highly heritable, and has been correlated with visual acuity and visual perception. However, it is still largely unknown what specific genetic and environmental factors contribute to normal variation in the area of visual cortex. To identify SNPs associated with the proportional surface area of visual cortex, we performed a genome-wide association study followed by replication in two independent cohorts. We identified one SNP (rs6116869) that replicated in both cohorts and had genome-wide significant association (P(combined) = 3.2 × 10(-8)). Furthermore, a metaanalysis of imputed SNPs in this genomic region identified a more significantly associated SNP (rs238295; P = 6.5 × 10(-9)) that was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs6116869. These SNPs are located within 4 kb of the 5' UTR of GPCPD1, glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase GDE1 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which in humans, is more highly expressed in occipital cortex compared with the remainder of cortex than 99.9{\%} of genes genome-wide. Based on these findings, we conclude that this common genetic variation contributes to the proportional area of human visual cortex. We suggest that identifying genes that contribute to normal cortical architecture provides a first step to understanding genetic mechanisms that underlie visual perception.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory proteins including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been associated with incident cognitive impairment, but little research has addressed their effects on the rate of cognitive change, and findings are mixed. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between serum levels of IL-6 and CRP and the rate of cognitive change across a range of cognitive domains in a sample of healthy older persons. METHODS: Growth curve analysis was performed on data from the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging, a longitudinal cohort study of high-functioning older adults aged 70-79 years at baseline in 1988 and reinterviewed in 1991 and 1995 (N = 851). Individual growth curve parameters were derived from baseline and follow-up performance in abstraction, language, spatial ability, verbal recall, spatial recognition, and global cognitive function based on age, IL-6, CRP, and covariates. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, there is a generally linear negative relationship between inflammation and cognition, such that higher levels of inflammation are associated with lower levels of baseline cognitive function. After controlling for potential confounders, there was no effect of inflammation on baseline cognitive function or the rate of longitudinal cognitive change. However, persons in the top tertile on IL-6 were at an increased risk of incident declines on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). CONCLUSIONS: Although high levels of inflammation are associated with incident cognitive impairment, these results do not generalize to the full range of cognitive changes, where the role of inflammation appears to be marginal.},

In a previous publication, we showed that a model-based approach is required to address some of the existing challenges in the design of clinical trial protocols. Here, we illustrate how the implementation of an interim analysis (IA) may help to identify studies that are headed for failure, early in the trial before completion of treatment. In contrast to traditional IA procedures, an adaptive Bayesian approach is proposed to optimize the timing of analysis and decision criteria for futility and efficacy, taking into account enrollment rate and treatment response at intermediate visits in the trial. Validation procedures involving re-enrollment of patients confirmed the performance of the method. Our findings reveal that optimization of the timing and decision criteria at the interim stage is critical for the accuracy of the conclusions about treatment efficacy or futility.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ejaculate exposure through anoreceptive intercourse is associated with rapid CD4 cell loss. DESIGN: Self-reported behavioral, demographic data and blood samples were gathered longitudinally at ten semiannual visits from individuals participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A group of 937 HIV-seropositive men who were continuously followed for four to ten semiannual visits. OUTCOME MEASURES: A loss of 10{\%} or more in CD4 cells between the first two of any three consecutive semiannual visits that was followed by a 10{\%} or greater loss between the second and third visits. RESULTS: A period of rapid CD4 cell loss over three semiannual visits occurred in 389 of the 937 (42{\%}) HIV-seropositive men studied. Men who reported one or more anoreceptive intercourse partners with whom they were exposed to ejaculate (RAI-E) during the 12 months immediately preceding their visits were more than twice as likely to show this rapid CD4 cell loss compared with men with no such partners. CONCLUSIONS: The association between RAI-E partnerships and rapid CD4 cell loss suggests factors associated with ejaculate exposure (e.g., sexually transmitted diseases) may hasten the clinical progression of HIV disease. It is suggested that infectious diseases, which are known to be associated with ejaculate exposure, may be the causal factor underlying the association between RAI-E partnerships and rapid CD4 cell loss in these men, although the presence of these diseases was not ascertained in these data. HIV-infected individuals should be cautioned against unprotected anoreceptive intercourse.},

To draw out the practical implications of this study for strategies to integrate clinical evidence into general medical practice.

DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews.

SETTING: General practices in Lothian.

SUBJECTS: 24 general practitioners selected to obtain a heterogeneous sample.

RESULTS: Respondents were generally aware of the evidence relating to the use of statins in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, but they were less clear about the evidence in primary prevention. The benefits of statins in secondary prevention were clearer to them and the social and economic issues less complex than was the case for use in primary prevention. Respondents rarely said they appraised the methods and content of trials, rather they judged the trustworthiness of the source of trial evidence and interpreted it within the context of the economic and social factors which impinge on their practice. Moreover, trial data become relevant for routine practice only when underpinned by a consensus on these issues.

CONCLUSION: Strategies to promote incorporation of evidence from clinical trials into everyday practice are likely to be effective if they tap into and build on the process of local consensus building. Strategies such as teaching critical appraisal skills and guideline development may have little effect if they are separated from this process.},

abstract = {The asymptotic log-rank and generalized Wilcoxon tests are the standard procedures for comparing samples of possibly censored survival times. For comparison of samples of very different sizes, an exact test is available that is based on a complete permutation of log-rank or Wilcoxon scores. While the asymptotic tests do not keep their nominal sizes if sample sizes differ substantially, the exact complete permutation test requires equal follow-up of the samples. Therefore, we have developed and present two new exact tests also suitable for unequal follow-up. The first of these is an exact analogue of the asymptotic log-rank test and conditions on observed risk sets, whereas the second approach permutes survival times while conditioning on the realized follow-up in each group. In an empirical study, we compare the new procedures with the asymptotic log-rank test, the exact complete permutation test, and an earlier proposed approach that equalizes the follow-up distributions using artificial censoring. Results confirm highly satisfactory performance of the exact procedure conditioning on realized follow-up, particularly in case of unequal follow-up. The advantage of this test over other options of analysis is finally exemplified in the analysis of a breast cancer study.},

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

Comprehensive metadata describing the semantics of the data are needed to leverage it for further research like cross-trial analysis. Current clinical trial management systems mostly lack sufficient metadata and are not semantically interoperable. This paper outlines our approach to develop an application that allows trial chairmen to design their trial and especially the required data management system with comprehensive metadata according to their needs, integrating a clinical trial ontology into the design process. To demonstrate the built-in interoperability of data management systems developed in this way, we integrate these applications into a European biomedical Grid for cancer research in a way that the research data collected in the data management systems can be seamlessly analyzed and mined by researchers.},

These procedures are contrasted to covariate adaptive procedures such as minimization and to response adaptive procedures such as the play-the-winner rule. General recommendations are offered regarding the use of complete, permuted-block, or urn randomization. In a large double-masked trial, any of these procedures may be acceptable. For a given trial, the relative merits of each procedure should be carefully weighed in relation to the characteristics of the trial. Important considerations are the size of the trial, overall as well as within the smallest subgroup to be employed in a subgroup-specific analysis, whether or not the trial is to be masked, and the resources needed to perform the proper randomization-based permutational analysis.},

abstract = {We evaluated the testing and reporting of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in recent genetic association studies, detected how frequently HWE was violated and estimated the power for HWE testing in this literature. Genetic association studies published in 2002 in Nature Genetics, American Journal of Human Genetics, and American Journal of Medical Genetics were assessed. Data were analyzed on 239 biallelic associations using 154 distinct genotype distribution data sets where HWE could be tested. Any information on HWE was given only for 150 (62.8{\%}) associations (92 (59.7{\%}) data sets). Reanalysis of the data showed significant deviation from HWE in the disease-free controls of 20 associations (13 data sets), but only four of them (two data sets) were admitted in the published articles. Another four deviations (in two data sets) were observed in the combined sample of cases and controls of studies where both cases and controls were diseased, and none were reported in the papers. In all six tested multiallelic associations (six data sets), there was violation of HWE, but this was not admitted in the published articles. Power calculations showed that most studies conforming to HWE simply were largely underpowered to detect HWE deviation; for example, power to detect an inbreeding of magnitude F=0.10 exceeded 80{\%} in only 11 (7{\%}) of the data sets being tested. This empirical evidence suggests that, even in high profile genetics journals, testing and reporting for HWE is often neglected and deviations are rarely admitted in the published reports. Moreover, power is limited for HWE testing in most current genetic association studies.},

abstract = {Mixed effect models are fundamental tools for the analysis of longitudinal data, panel data and cross-sectional data. They are widely used by various fields of social sciences, medical and biological sciences. However, the complex nature of these models has made variable selection and parameter estimation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a simple iterative procedure that estimates and selects fixed and random effects for linear mixed models. In particular, we propose to utilize the partial consistency property of the random effect coefficients and select groups of random effects simultaneously via a data-oriented penalty function (the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty function). We show that the proposed method is a consistent variable selection procedure and possesses some oracle properties. Simulation studies and a real data analysis are also conducted to empirically examine the performance of this procedure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background In randomized trials, prazosin, an $\alpha$1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, has been effective in alleviating nightmares associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military veterans. Methods We recruited veterans from 13 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers who had chronic PTSD and reported frequent nightmares. Participants were randomly assigned to receive prazosin or placebo for 26 weeks; the drug or placebo was administered in escalating divided doses over the course of 5 weeks to a daily maximum of 20 mg in men and 12 mg in women. After week 10, participants continued to receive prazosin or placebo in a double-blind fashion for an additional 16 weeks. The three primary outcome measures were the change in score from baseline to 10 weeks on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) item B2 ("recurrent distressing dreams"; scores range from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more frequent and more distressing dreams); the change in score from baseline to 10 weeks on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality); and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) score at 10 weeks (scores range from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating greater improvement and a score of 4 indicating no change). Results A total of 304 participants underwent randomization; 152 were assigned to prazosin, and 152 to placebo. At 10 weeks, there were no significant differences between the prazosin group and the placebo group in the mean change from baseline in the CAPS item B2 score (between-group difference, 0.2; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -0.3 to 0.8; P=0.38), in the mean change in PSQI score (between-group difference, 0.1; 95{\%} CI, -0.9 to 1.1; P=0.80), or in the CGIC score (between-group difference, 0; 95{\%} CI, -0.3 to 0.3; P=0.96). There were no significant differences in these measures at 26 weeks (a secondary outcome) or in other secondary outcomes. At 10 weeks, the mean difference between the prazosin group and the placebo group in the change from baseline in supine systolic blood pressure was a decrease of 6.7 mm Hg. The adverse event of new or worsening suicidal ideation occurred in 8{\%} of the participants assigned to prazosin versus 15{\%} of those assigned to placebo. Conclusions In this trial involving military veterans who had chronic PTSD, prazosin did not alleviate distressing dreams or improve sleep quality.

abstract = {Clinical trials on early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reaching a bottleneck because none of the current disease markers changes appreciably early in the disease process and therefore a huge sample is required to adequately power such trials. We propose a method to combine multiple markers so that the longitudinal rate of progression can be improved. The criterion is to maximize the probability that the combined marker will be decreased over time (assuming a negative mean slope for each marker). We propose estimates to the weights of markers in the optimum combination and a confidence interval estimate to the combined rate of progression through the maximum likelihood estimates and a bootstrap procedure. We conduct simulations to assess the performance of our estimates and compare our approach with the first principal component from a principal component analysis. The proposed method is applied to a real world sample of individuals with preclinical AD to combine measures from two cognitive domains. The combined cognitive marker is finally used to design future clinical trials on preclinical AD, demonstrating a significant improvement in reducing the sample sizes needed to power such trials when compared with individual markers alone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous patient- and disease-related factors increase the risk of rapid cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability of pharmacological treatment to attenuate this risk remains undefined. METHODS: Pooled data from 14 randomized clinical studies of donepezil in the treatment of AD (N = 3748) were analyzed to identify predictors of fast decline and determine the effect of donepezil on the risk of fast decline. RESULTS: Young age and more severe baseline cognitive, global, or behavioral status were identified as independent predictors of faster decline in placebo-treated patients. Multivariate models indicated that donepezil treatment was associated with a 39{\%} to 63{\%} reduction in the risk of faster decline. CONCLUSIONS: These results correspond with previous findings, indicating relationships between age or baseline disease severity and rates of cognitive decline. Furthermore, they suggest that symptomatic therapy for AD could reduce the likelihood of faster decline in treated patients.},
