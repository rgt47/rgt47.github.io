I have on occasion found them useful particulary in defining an order among categorical variables. see example 2 below, but more often they have been a hassle to deal with rather than a help.\nThe typical scenario is when a data set is read from a csv file and the input function (e.g. read.csv() ) decides to declare a numeric variable to be a factor. and categorical variable which should be categorical are defined as factors.\nWhy does this happen? Why is it necessary to use the readAsFactor=False flag in order to get the more sensible behavior.\nLets look back at some of the correspondence between R core members to see what the original thinking was…\nConsider the following data set (borrowed from https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_factors.htm\n\nheight weight gender 1 132 48 male 2 151 49 male 3 162 66 female 4 139 53 female 5 166 67 male 6 147 52 female 7 122 40 male [1] FALSE [1] “male” “male” “female” “female” “male” “female” “male”\n\nRunning the above on the tutorialspoint web site gives a true response for is.factor(gender). But when I run it I get a false. The web site indicates R version 3.4.1 is being run. My version is 4.1.2.\nInteresting. Did the default change somewhere along the line? Let check the release notes. for 4.1\nSample reference section reference.
