# Introduction
This post provides a detailed description of creating a low-cost* virtual server
on Amazon AWS. 

* AWS offers a free set of servers for the first 12 months. 

* Open EC2 console. 
```sh
   https://aws.amazon.com/console
```
   or
```sh
   https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#
```

```{r out.width = "300px"}
include_graphics("ec2a.png")

```

* log in


After logging in to AWS start by setting up a working environment. In particular

* ssh
* Domain Name 
* Static IP

* side panel, click "ec2"
* side panel, click "Instances"
* from top bar, click "Launch Instances"

2. From "Quick Start" click Ubuntu button. 
* Name the server say shiny-july22
*      Choose an AMI (instance template, operating system):

Suggest choose "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS", but other linux distributions can be utilized, e.g.u 
Red Hat, or SUSE.)

e.g. ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-20220609

3. Next choose an instance **type**, e.g. "t2-micro". (different instances are
   mixtures of size, processors, memory, instance storage, network performance) 
click "Next: Configure Instance Details"

*. choose Key pair (use in place aws18.pem) or set up new pair

The first time you create an AWS account you need to exchange an SSH key pair
with AWS.

You can generate an ssh key pair locally and upload public key to EC2. 

Create a directory to hold the keys. e.g. ~/.ssh.

From inside .ssh generate the keys with the command

> ssh-gen -PEM ???
name keys something like ssh-rsa.

On EC2 select security/keys and upload the import the public key.

Add security group, e.g. 'shiny' (sg-0f37c94ac1e1b6250) 
allowing ports 80 (http), 22 (ssh), 443 (https), and 3838 (shiny). 
and 8787 

choose  30 GB of EBS General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic storage   

click Launch Instance


Use elastic IP (to allow server to be run "on-demand")
* click on elastic IP in left panel
* select associate Elastic IP  13.57.139.31
  choose an instance (shiny-july22) to associate with. 

Log into new instance with ssh from local

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/aws18.pem ubuntu@13.57.139.31
```
or 
```sh
ssh ec2 

```
if you've set up a ``config`` file in ``~/.ssh`` (see Tips at the end of the
blog)


set up the environment on server. There is only one piece of software to
install: Docker. 

```sh
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y upgrade

apt-get install -y \
    docker \
    docker-compose

systemctl enable docker
# or use homebrew for linux


```
Add ubuntu to the docker group

get domain name from Route 53. 

Go to godaddy or Amazon route 53 to associate a domain name with the Elastic IP
in EC2. 

(screenshot) 

To associate domain name rgtlab.org.
in Route 53: 

* click on 'hosted zones' in side panel
* click on rgtlab.org in center panel
* click on checkbox for rgtlab.org type=A line
* then click on edit record in right panel
* change ip address to 13.57.139.31
