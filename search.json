      "contents": "\nThis post examines the features of R Markdown using knitr in Rstudio 0.96. This combination of tools provides an exciting improvement in usability for reproducible analysis. Specifically, this post (1) discusses getting started with R Markdown and knitr in Rstudio 0.96; (2) provides a basic example of producing console output and plots using R Markdown; (3) highlights several code chunk options such as caching and controlling how input and output is displayed; (4) demonstrates use of standard Markdown notation as well as the extended features of formulas and tables; and (5) discusses the implications of R Markdown. This post was produced with R Markdown. The source code is available here as a gist. The post may be most useful if the source code and displayed post are viewed side by side. In some instances, I include a copy of the R Markdown in the displayed HTML, but most of the time I assume you are reading the source and post side by side.\n\nGetting started\nTo work with R Markdown, if necessary:\nInstall R\nInstall the lastest version of RStudio (at time of posting, this is 0.96)\nInstall the latest version of the knitr package: install.packages(\"knitr\")\nTo run the basic working example that produced this blog post:\nOpen R Studio, and go to File - New - R Markdown\nIf necessary install ggplot2 and lattice packages: install.packages(\"ggplot2\"); install.packages(\"lattice\")\nPaste in the contents of this gist (which contains the R Markdown file used to produce this post) and save the file with an .rmd extension\nClick Knit HTML\nPrepare for analyses\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lattice)\n\n\n\nBasic console output\nTo insert an R code chunk, you can type it manually or just press Chunks - Insert chunks or use the shortcut key. This will produce the following code chunk:\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\n\n\n<\/div>\nPressing tab when inside the braces will bring up code chunk options.\nThe following R code chunk labelled basicconsole is as follows:\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span class='va'>x<\/span> <span class='op'>&lt;-<\/span> <span class='fl'>1<\/span><span class='op'>:<\/span><span class='fl'>10<\/span>\n<span class='va'>y<\/span> <span class='op'>&lt;-<\/span> <span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html'>round<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html'>rnorm<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='fl'>10<\/span>, <span class='va'>x<\/span>, <span class='fl'>1<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span>, <span class='fl'>2<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span>\n<span class='va'>df<\/span> <span class='op'>&lt;-<\/span> <span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html'>data.frame<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='va'>x<\/span>, <span class='va'>y<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span>\n<span class='va'>df<\/span>\n<\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n|  x|     y|\n|--:|-----:|\n|  1| -0.21|\n|  2|  2.28|\n|  3|  4.08|\n|  4|  1.65|\n|  5|  5.43|\n|  6|  6.51|\n|  7|  6.43|\n|  8|  7.45|\n|  9|  8.44|\n| 10|  9.11|\n\n<\/div>\nThe code chunk input and output is then displayed as follows:\n\n\nx <- 1:10\ny <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\ndf <- data.frame(x, y)\ndf\n\n\nx\ny\n1\n0.52\n2\n1.00\n3\n2.22\n4\n4.06\n5\n5.96\n6\n5.89\n7\n6.49\n8\n7.09\n9\n8.16\n10\n12.42\n\nPlots\nImages generated by knitr are saved in a figures folder. However, they also appear to be represented in the HTML output using a data URI scheme. This means that you can paste the HTML into a blog post or discussion forum and you don’t have to worry about finding a place to store the images; they’re embedded in the HTML.\nSimple plot\nHere is a basic plot using base graphics:\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html'>plot<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='va'>x<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span>\n<\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n<img src=\"exampleRmarkdown_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png\" width=\"624\" />\n\n<\/div>\n\n\nplot(x)\n\n\n\n\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to write fig=TRUE.\nMultiple plots\nAlso, unlike traditional Sweave, you can include multiple plots in one code chunk:\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/boxplot.html'>boxplot<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='fl'>1<\/span><span class='op'>:<\/span><span class='fl'>10<\/span><span class='op'>~<\/span><span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/rep.html'>rep<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='fl'>1<\/span><span class='op'>:<\/span><span class='fl'>2<\/span>,<span class='fl'>5<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span>\n<\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n<img src=\"exampleRmarkdown_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png\" width=\"624\" /><div class=\"sourceCode\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html'>plot<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='va'>x<\/span>, <span class='va'>y<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span>\n<\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n<img src=\"exampleRmarkdown_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png\" width=\"624\" />\n\n<\/div>\n\n\nboxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\n\n\n\nplot(x, y)\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 plot\nGgplot2 plots work well:\n\n\nqplot(x, y, data=df)\n\n\n\n\nlattice plot\nAs do lattice plots:\n\n\nxyplot(y~x)\n\n\n\n\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to print lattice plots directly.\nR Code chunk features\nCreate Markdown code from R\nThe following code hides the command input (i.e., echo=FALSE), and outputs the content directly as code (i.e., results=asis, which is similar to results=tex in Sweave).\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\nHere are some dot points\n\n* The value of y[1] is 0.52\n* The value of y[2] is 1\n* The value of y[3] is 2.22\n\n<\/div>\n\nHere are some dot points\nThe value of y[1] is 0.52\nThe value of y[2] is 1\nThe value of y[3] is 2.22\n\nCreate Markdown table code from R\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\nx | y\n--- | ---\n1 | 0.52\n2 | 1\n3 | 2.22\n4 | 4.06\n5 | 5.96\n6 | 5.89\n7 | 6.49\n8 | 7.09\n9 | 8.16\n10 | 12.42\n\n<\/div>\n\nx\ny\n1\n0.52\n2\n1\n3\n2.22\n4\n4.06\n5\n5.96\n6\n5.89\n7\n6.49\n8\n7.09\n9\n8.16\n10\n12.42\n\nControl output display\nThe folllowing code supresses display of R input commands (i.e., echo=FALSE) and removes any preceding text from console output (comment=\"\"; the default is comment=\"##\").\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\n\n|  x|    y|\n|--:|----:|\n|  1| 0.52|\n|  2| 1.00|\n|  3| 2.22|\n|  4| 4.06|\n|  5| 5.96|\n|  6| 5.89|\n\n<\/div>\n\nx\ny\n1\n0.52\n2\n1.00\n3\n2.22\n4\n4.06\n5\n5.96\n6\n5.89\n\nControl figure size\nThe following is an example of a smaller figure using fig.width and fig.height options.\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html'>plot<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='va'>x<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span>\n<\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n<img src=\"exampleRmarkdown_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png\" width=\"288\" />\n\n<\/div>\n\n\nplot(x)\n\n\n\n\nCache analysis\nCaching analyses is straightforward. Here’s example code. On the first run on my computer, this took about 10 seconds. On subsequent runs, this code was not run.\nIf you want to rerun cached code chunks, just delete the contents of the cache folder\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span class='kw'>for<\/span> <span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='va'>i<\/span> <span class='kw'>in<\/span> <span class='fl'>1<\/span><span class='op'>:<\/span><span class='fl'>5000<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span> <span class='op'>{<\/span>\n    <span class='fu'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html'>lm<\/a><\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='op'>(<\/span><span class='va'>i<\/span><span class='op'>+<\/span><span class='fl'>1<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span><span class='op'>~<\/span><span class='va'>i<\/span><span class='op'>)<\/span>\n<span class='op'>}<\/span>\n<\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n\n<\/div>\nBasic markdown functionality\nFor those not familiar with standard Markdown, the following may be useful. See the source code for how to produce such points. However, RStudio does include a Markdown quick reference button that adequatly covers this material.\nDot Points\nSimple dot points:\nPoint 1\nPoint 2\nPoint 3\nand numeric dot points:\nNumber 1\nNumber 2\nNumber 3\nand nested dot points:\nA\nA.1\nA.2\n\nB\nB.1\nB.2\n\nEquations\nEquations are included by using LaTeX notation and including them either between single dollar signs (inline equations) or double dollar signs (displayed equations). If you hang around the Q&A site CrossValidated you’ll be familiar with this idea.\nThere are inline equations such as \\(y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i + e_i\\).\nAnd displayed formulas:\n\\[\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-x)}\\]\nknitr provides self-contained HTML code that calls a Mathjax script to display formulas. However, in order to include the script in my blog posts I took the script and incorporated it into my blogger template. If you are viewing this post through syndication or an RSS reader, this may not work. You may need to view this post on my website.\nTables\nTables can be included using the following notation\nA\nB\nC\n1\nMale\nBlue\n2\nFemale\nPink\nHyperlinks\nIf you like this post, you may wish to subscribe to my RSS feed.\nImages\nHere’s an example image:\nimage from redmond barry building unimelbCode\nHere is Markdown R code chunk displayed as code:\n<div class=\"layout-chunk\" data-layout=\"l-body\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span class='va'>x<\/span> <span class='op'>&lt;-<\/span> <span class='fl'>1<\/span><span class='op'>:<\/span><span class='fl'>10<\/span>\n<span class='va'>x<\/span>\n<\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n\n```\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n```\n\n<\/div>\nAnd then there’s inline code such as x <- 1:10.\nQuote\nLet’s quote some stuff:\n\nTo be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\n\nConclusion\nR Markdown is awesome.\nThe ratio of markup to content is excellent.\nFor exploratory analyses, blog posts, and the like R Markdown will be a powerful productivity booster.\nFor journal articles, LaTeX will presumably still be required.\n\nThe RStudio team have made the whole process very user friendly.\nRStudio provides useful shortcut keys for compiling to HTML, and running code chunks. These shortcut keys are presented in a clear way.\nThe incorporated extensions to Markdown, particularly formula and table support, are particularly useful.\nJump-to-chunk feature facilitates navigation. It helps if your code chunks have informative names.\nCode completion on R code chunk options is really helpful. See also chunk options documentation on the knitr website.\n\nOther recent posts on R markdown include those by :\nChristopher Gandrud\nMarkcus Gesmann\nRstudio on R Markdown\nYihui Xie: I really want to thank him for developing knitr. He has also posted this example of R Markdown.\n\nQuestions\nThe following are a few questions I encountered along the way that might interest others. ### Annoying <br/>’s Question: I asked on the Rstudio discussion site: Why does Markdown to HTML insert <br/> on new lines?\nAnswer: I just do a find and delete on this text for now.\nTemporarily disable caching\nQuestion: I asked on StackOverflow about How to set cache=FALSE for a knitr markdown document and override code chunk settings?\nAnswer: Delete the cache folder. But there are other possible workflows.\nEquivalent of Sexpr\nQuestion: I asked on Stack Overvlow about whether there an R Markdown equivalent to Sexpr in Sweave?.\nAnswer: Include the code between brackets of “backick r space” and “backtick”. E.g., in the source code I have calculated 2 + 2 = 4 .\n\n\n\n",
